Supplied Vitit Muntarbhorn, UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Cambodia, resigned from the position due to “health reasons” some two weeks ago, following widespread criticisms over his inaction on the situation of human rights at the Cambodian-Thailand border. “I regret very much to inform you that, due to health reasons, I resign from my position as Special Rapporteur on the human rights situation in Cambodia. My resignation is effective with this letter of resignation,” he wrote in a letter to the UN in Geneva, Switzerland. The letter, seen by The Post on December 6, was dated November 24. “I have had the pleasure of supporting the mandate of the UN Human Rights Council for five years since my appointment as special rapporteur on the human rights situation in Cambodia. It has been a great honour to promote and protect human rights in the country, and to be of assistance to the people of the land,” he said. “I have undertaken the work as an independent expert appointed by the UN Human Rights Council as a mark of my commitment to human rights, democracy, peace and sustainable development worldwide,” he added. Muntarbhorn, a Thai national, held the position since March 2021, but was recently criticised for inaction regarding the human rights situation along the borders, included the killing of a Cambodian civilian in Banteay Meanchey by Thai soldiers, the alleged gangrape of a Cambodian migrant worker by Thai forces and the situation of displaced people.",

FN From around 5am this morning, December 8, Thai armed forces opened fire on Cambodian military positions in the An Seh area of Preah Vihear province. Later, Thai armoured vehicles fired at the Ta Moan Templle, according to Maly Socheata, spokesperson for the Ministry of National Defence. She added that shots were also fired at the Preah Vihear temple area, as well as the January 5 and Chamkar Chek areas. The attacks were described by the spokesperson as the latest of several provocative Thai activities, including yesterday’s gunfire, all seemingly carries out with “with the intention of instigating a clash”. “Based on the spirit of respecting all agreed-upon agreements and peacefully resolving disputes in accordance with international law, Cambodian forces did not retaliate to these attacks. We are continuing to monitor this development with utmost caution and attention,” she said. She noted that Cambodia has already informed the ASEAN Observer Team (AOT), and plans to ask observers to visit the scene of the latest incidents to conduct an investigation to find the truth and ensure transparency, justice and accuracy. “The Ministry of National Defence of the Kingdom of Cambodia unequivocally condemns this inhumane and brutal act. It clearly shows that the Thai side has violated the Joint Statement on the Peace Agreement between Cambodia and Thailand, which both sides signed on October 26, 2025, witnessed by His Excellency Donald Trump, President of the United States of America, and His Excellency Anwar Ibrahim, Prime Minister of Malaysia and Chairman of ASEAN,” said Socheata.

            "content": "As a State Party, Cambodia is legally bound to eliminate anti-personnel mines, destroy stockpiles and clear all known contaminated areas under Article 5 obligations. CMAC Cambodia has received formal approval for a new deadline to complete its nationwide anti-personnel mine clearance, after state parties to the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention unanimously backed the country’s third extension request, during a meeting in Geneva from December 1–5. The decision sets December 31, 2030, as Cambodia’s revised target for fulfilling its obligations under Article 5 of the Ottawa Convention, an extension to the Kingdom’s decades-long effort to eliminate landmines left from past conflicts. According to the Cambodian Mine Action and Victim Assistance Authority (CMAA), the approval reflects strong international confidence in Cambodia’s mine action programme and its “sustained leadership, strong commitment and substantial efforts” in recent years. Cambodia became a state party to the Ottawa Convention in 2000 and has already requested two previous deadline extensions: the first from 2010 to 2019, and the second from 2020 to 2025. The Kingdom has faced several challenges meeting the previous deadlines, including a lack of resources and the discovery of additional contaminated areas, particularly along the Thai-Cambodian border. Cambodia has cleared 3,300 square kilometres of contaminated land and destroyed more than four million landmines and explosive remnants of war (ERWs) to date — work that has reduced casualties, boosted community safety and supported economic development across former conflict areas. Despite this progress, the convention members and Cambodian officials acknowledged that the hardest work lies ahead, particularly in heavily contaminated border zones where thick forests, mountainous terrain and extensive minefields continue to pose extreme risks. “These areas remain difficult to access and require additional resources and strengthened partnerships,” the CMAA noted, warning that clearing the remaining contamination will demand sustained international support. Cambodia used the Geneva meeting to renew its appeal to friendly nations, development partners, mine action operators and the private sector to continue backing its push toward a “Mine-Free Cambodia 2030”. The CMAA expressed gratitude to donors and partners for their long-standing assistance, saying their contributions have been instrumental in transforming former battlegrounds into productive farmland, transportation routes and community settlements. As Cambodia enters the final stretch of mine clearance, the new 2030 deadline serves as both an opportunity and a warning: the country is closer than ever to achieving its mine-free ambition, but the remaining challenges are some of the most complex it has faced. ICRC urges stronger global commitment The International Committee of the Red Cross has urged governments to reinforce their commitment to the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention, warning that global support for the treaty is beginning to erode at a time when armed conflicts are increasing. Addressing the 22nd Meeting of States Parties, the ICRC Vice-President Jürg Lauber said mine casualties climbed to more than 6,000 last year — 90 per cent of them civilians — underscoring the severe humanitarian and economic toll of landmine use. The ICRC called on states to act in four areas: first, fully implementing the convention at the national level; second, strengthening the stigma against anti-personnel mines by clearly condemning any use; third, urging countries considering withdrawal to remain committed; and fourth, pressing non-member states to join without delay. The ICRC pledged continued support, stressing that political will is essential to maintain the convention as a cornerstone of civilian protection. Cambodia’s role in the Ottawa Convention Cambodia has been a committed member of the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention since signing the treaty on December 3, 1997, and formally ratifying it on July 28, 1999, with the Convention entering into force for the country on 1 January 2000. As a state party, Cambodia is legally bound to eliminate anti-personnel mines, destroy stockpiles and clear all known contaminated areas under Article 5 obligations. Its longstanding participation places Cambodia among the earliest adopters of the Ottawa Convention in Southeast Asia, reflecting the country’s determination to address one of the region’s heaviest legacies of landmines. Cambodia’s continued engagement — most recently through its request for a third extension to complete nationwide clearance — underscores its status as a frontline State Party implementing the treaty’s humanitarian and security goals.",

Hin Pisei Investment projects approved by the Council for the Development of Cambodia’s (CDC) Cambodian Investment Committee totalled more than 600 in the first 11 months of 2025 — an increase of nearly 60% compared to the same period in 2024. Kampong Speu and Svay Rieng provinces were the top destinations. According to a December 4 CDC press release, between January and November, the investment committee registered 609 investment projects (237 of them in Special Economic Zones), totalling $9.5 billion in investment capital. Among them, the number of approved projects increased by 220, equivalent to 57%, while investment capital rose by approximately $3 billion, or 47%, compared to the same period in 2024. The projects are expected to create roughly 426,000 new jobs. Kampong Speu received the highest number of investment projects at 136, followed by Svay Rieng with 135, Phnom Penh with 75, Takeo with 60, Koh Kong with 50, Preah Sihanouk with 50, Kandal with 48, and Kampong Chhnang with 21. Of the total investment capital, China accounted for 52.62%, Cambodia 32.49%, Singapore 4.49%, followed by Vietnam, the British Virgin Islands, the UK and the US. In 2024, the CDC approved a total of 414 investment projects. In November 2025 alone, 34 projects were registered (12 in Special Economic Zones), with an investment capital of around $262 million. They are expected to create 24,000 jobs. Deputy Prime Minister Sun Chanthol, first vice-president of the CDC, stated during the inauguration of the Cambodia Trade Expo 2025 on December 4, that the number of CDC-approved projects in the first 11 months of 2025 represents a new record. In 2024, CDC broke previous records, with 414 approved investment projects. “At this point, I also want to share that Cambodia’s investment climate has gained global recognition for two consecutive years,” he said. He continued that, on behalf of the Royal Government, he is proud and appreciative of the Ministry of Commerce, the CDC, relevant ministries and institutions, and the private sector for their continued cooperation in trade negotiations, investment promotion, and the strengthening of economic and commercial growth through imports and the expansion of Cambodian products in regional and global markets. Royal Academy of Cambodia economist Hong Vanak told The Post on December 5 that the surge in CDC-approved investment projects demonstrates investor confidence and the market opportunities they see in Cambodia’s direct investment environment. He noted that Cambodia is a politically stable country with strong economic growth and has numerous bilateral and multilateral free trade agreements, adding that improvements to investment laws and transport infrastructure are becoming additional magnets for attracting more investors. “Before deciding to invest in any country, investors conduct detailed studies on various factors, such as investment law, the labour force, export markets, sources of raw materials and transport infrastructure. The growth of direct investment shows that Cambodia is improving across all sectors,” he added. According to FDI Intelligence, in 2024 Cambodia ranked at the top of the FDI Standouts Watchlist, confirming that Cambodia is one of the most promising emerging markets for investment. According to Chnathol, in 2025, Cambodia continued to rank No. 1 in the Asia-Pacific region and No. 9 globally in the Greenfield FDI Performance Index, which measures how effectively countries attract investment, relative to the size of their economies.",

Agriculture minister Dith Tina met with a delegation from Filipino company Food Terminal Incorporated, according to a December 3 social media post by the minister. The delegation was led by Joseph Rudolf Lo, president and CEO of the company, and aimed to explore the feasibility of direct rice orders from Cambodia to the Philippines. Should the effort be successful, it will open additional markets for paddy rice for Cambodian farmers, according to the minister’s post. Tina explained that the ministry facilitated a direct meeting between the Philippines’ delegation and the Cambodia Rice Federation (CRF), to negotiate export details and expedite the ordering process. “Establishing this new agri-business connection will provide mutual benefits for both countries. The Philippines will secure a source of high-quality rice, while Cambodia will gain another new international market,” he said. \"The opening of this new rice market will also enable the ministry's partner rice mills to purchase more paddy rice from our farmers on a broader scale,” he added.

            "content": "Malaysia’s 2025 Asean chairmanship marked significant achievements and renewed drive for the bloc, but major turning points and unresolved issues still lie ahead. Following a year defined by intense diplomacy and regional adjustment, Malaysia’s stewardship of Asean in 2025 injected new energy into economic integration and external partnerships — helping reinforce the bloc’s role as a stabilising force in an increasingly competitive Indo-Pacific. With leadership shifting and geopolitical pressures mounting, the question once again arises: what direction will Asean take next? Strategic fine-tuning Malaysia’s tenure saw several notable diplomatic and economic advances. Vietnamese deputy foreign minister Dong Hoang Giang recently told FMT that 2025 delivered “strong breakthroughs in economic growth and innovation” throughout Asean. Over the past year, progress was recorded in negotiations on the Asean Digital Economy Framework Agreement (DEFA), the launch of the Asean Geo-Economics Task Force, the unveiling of Asean Community Vision 2045 and the start of efforts to establish a more unified long-term strategy. Dong highlighted that “New frameworks are gradually taking shape,” citing DEFA, the Asean Power Grid and the Asean Digital Master Plan. “These lay the foundation for a digital community driven by science, technology, and innovation,” he said. One signature moment of 2025 was the first-ever Asean–Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)–China Summit. Speaking at the Asean Outlook on the Indo-Pacific (AOIP) Forum, Institute of Strategic and International Studies chairman Faiz Abdullah noted that bringing China into the Asean-GCC framework gives the partnership “even more depth”. “China’s technological advancement and financial infrastructure complement the GCC’s substantial resources,” he explained, adding that Asean’s capacity to gather such diverse players underscores its centrality amid rising tensions. US ambassador to Malaysia Edward Kagan, in a recent FMT interview, similarly highlighted the region’s strategic weight, saying Washington recognises that the “most important chapters” of this century will unfold in the Indo-Pacific. Amid intensifying competition among global powers, Asean has sought to maintain control over its regional agenda by convening partners and promoting common interests. At the AOIP Forum, Asean-Malaysia National Secretariat director general Zanariah Zainal Abidin stressed that the Indo-Pacific should not be viewed as a theatre of rivalry. “It is a region where inclusivity is power, sustainability is strategy and centrality is responsibility,” she said. “Asean’s strength lies in dialogue, in our ability to bridge divides and in our commitment to ensuring that the Indo-Pacific remains open, inclusive, and cooperative,” she noted. Work still to be done Despite the upbeat progress, Asean’s real challenge is implementation. Several initiatives — including the Geo-Economic Task Force and Asean Industrial Strategy — remain in the preliminary stages. ISEAS–Yusof Ishak Institute senior fellow Joanne Lin recently cautioned that Asean must improve its follow-through by developing sector-specific action plans, financing options and greater collaboration with industry. This urgency is heightened by the region’s position between competing technology ecosystems and the resurgence of economic nationalism worldwide. At the 9th Asean Media Forum (Nov 6), Malaysia’s deputy investment, trade, and industry minister Liew Chin Tong suggested that Asean could become the “champion of middle technology”, functioning as a dependable, neutral technology hub. “As long as Asean – particularly Malaysia, Singapore, and Vietnam – build a reputation as a reliable semiconductor source, we can weather geopolitical tensions,” he said. Internal disparities remain a key concern, especially after Timor-Leste was admitted as the 11th member. “If we don’t act, Asean could split into three tiers of wealth,” veteran diplomat Ilango Karuppannan warned in a recent interview, adding, “We don’t want this kind of division to threaten Asean’s cohesion”. At the same time, the tentative rapprochement between Thailand and Cambodia requires cautious handling, and the bloc still lacks a comprehensive peacekeeping mechanism. In an FMT column, International Islamic University professor Phar Kim Beng emphasised that consultation and consensus continue to be vital. “What is needed is the political will to activate existing mechanisms and coordinate them effectively in the field,” he said. The Philippines takes the lead The Philippines will chair Asean in 2026 under the theme “Navigating Our Future, Together”. With a slowing global economy and continued geopolitical uncertainty, the coming year is expected to be even more demanding than 2025. At the AOIP Forum, Faiz highlighted how Southeast Asia’s interests are increasingly tied to a complicated and unpredictable external landscape. “The lines between geopolitics and geoeconomics have blurred and now move almost in lockstep,” he said, stressing the need for strong international cooperation. Philippine foreign affairs secretary Maria-Theresa Lazaro told FMT that Manila intends to pursue innovation without losing continuity. She said the country’s priorities align with the Asean Community’s three pillars and added that the Philippines aims to “build on what has already been done and achieved”. Manila’s agenda includes advancing the South China Sea Code of Conduct, expanding climate action and pushing for further progress on Myanmar — an issue that continues to test Asean unity. Toward a new phase Asean’s current momentum is the result of sustained effort over many years, with Malaysia’s 2025 leadership sharpening the bloc’s focus amid rising geopolitical pressure and a slowing world economy. The year 2026 will test Asean’s ability to respond decisively. The central question is no longer whether Asean matters — its relevance is well-established — but whether it can deliver on the promises embedded in its frameworks, partnerships and people-centred aspirations. Malaysia and its partners have strengthened the foundational structure. It is now up to the region to determine what it will build upon it. Alina Khai is a Malaysian journalist.

Commerce ministry Although Cambodia was the very first country in the world to sign a reciprocal trade agreement with the US, with tariff rate of 19%, the Kingdom is still continuing its efforts to negotiate further reductions, especially for goods with strong export potential to the US market. Deputy Prime Minister Sun Chanthol, first vice-president of the Council for the Development of Cambodia (CDC), explained the process as he addressed the opening ceremony of the “Cambodia Trade Expo 2025” on the morning of December 4. He recalled that on April 2, the US government imposed reciprocal tariffs on Cambodian goods at a rate of 49%, one of the highest rates in the world, due to the Kingdom’s significant trade surplus with the US. Chanthol noted continued that, recognising the importance of the US market, the Cambodian government immediately established a working group for coordinating Cambodia–US bilateral trade and investment relations, with himself as chairman. He added that through numerous negotiations, the US government gradually reduced the reciprocal tariff rate on goods from Cambodia — from 49% to 36%, and then further down to 19%. “Cambodia was the first country in the world to sign a reciprocal trade agreement with the US at a 19% tariff rate on October 26, during the ASEAN Summit in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. This agreement provided clarity and strong confidence for investors exporting products to the large US market,” he said. Nevertheless, he explained that Cambodia is continuing to negotiate. “I myself, together with Her Excellency (the Minister of Commerce) and the working group, held follow-up discussions with the US side last week, via video conference,” he said. “Efforts are continuing to negotiate for further tariff reductions with the US on several priority sectors, including garments, textiles, footwear and travel goods. These sectors support a large labour force and especially provide many job opportunities for women, helping to improve the living standards of Cambodian people,” he added. According to Chanthol, growth in these sectors will quickly create jobs for the Cambodian workers who have recently returned from working abroad.",

Supplied As Indonesia and Cambodia celebrate their enduring friendship, the embassy of Indonesia in Phnom Penh is set to bring a taste of the archipelago to the heart of the capital through the Indonesia Night Market (Phsaar Reatrei Indonesia). Scheduled for November 15-16, at Chaktomuk Walk Street, the two-day cultural event will feature Indonesian cuisine, music and dance performances in a lively night market atmosphere. Ahead of the celebrations, Santo Darmosumarto, Indonesian ambassador, sat down with The Post to discuss the inspiration behind the event, its role in promoting cultural diplomacy, and how it seeks to strengthen people-to-people ties between the two nations. 1. Could you share details about how the Indonesia Night Market is set up — such as how many booths, what activities, the overall theme or design and the exact location along Chaktomuk Walk Street? The Indonesia Night Market (known as Phsaar Reatrei Indonesia in Khmer) will take place on November 15-16 at Chaktomuk Walk Street, in front of Wat Ounalom. This two-day event will feature 12 booths offering a wide variety of Indonesian culinary delights and products. Visitors can enjoy traditional Indonesian dance and music performances, as well as Dangdut, a popular Indonesian music genre, and a unique fusion of Indonesian and Khmer music performed by an Indonesian DJ. Guests will also have the opportunity to participate in fun games and win exciting prizes featuring Indonesian products. 2. What is the main objective of organising the Indonesia Night Market in Phnom Penh, and how does it reflect Indonesia’s cultural diplomacy efforts in Cambodia? By embracing the concept of a night market — a vibrant gathering place where people of all ages, backgrounds and cultures come together to spend time and share joy with their loved ones — the Phsaar Reatrei Indonesia aims to bring Indonesia closer to the Cambodian people. What better way to connect than by sharing the richness of Indonesian culture through music, dance and food, experiences that everyone can enjoy together? The event will be held at the popular Chaktomuk Walk Street over the weekend, a location that attracts large crowds. Hosting the Indonesia Night Market here is expected to increase the event’s visibility, introducing more people to Indonesian culture while also supporting the Cambodian government in enhancing the Walk Street as a tourist attraction. 3. How does this event contribute to strengthening people-to-people ties and cultural understanding between Indonesia and Cambodia? The Phsaar Reatrei Indonesia is part of Indonesia’s cultural diplomacy in Cambodia. Events like this serve as a bridge for mutual understanding, fostering stronger people-to-people connections. By experiencing Indonesian music, dance and food, visitors hopefully will gain a deeper appreciation for diversity and help cultivate positive perceptions about Indonesia. 4. Besides promoting culture, are there plans to use the Indonesia Night Market as a platform to boost tourism or trade between the two countries? In Indonesia, there is a proverb: “Tak kenal maka tak sayang”, which means “How can you love something you don’t know?” By sharing Indonesian culture through this event, we hope more Cambodian people will get to know Indonesia, inspiring them to visit the country and explore Indonesian products. Ultimately, cultural exchange at the Phsaar Reatrei Indonesia opens the door to greater opportunities for promoting tourism and enhancing trade between our nations. 5. What message would you like Cambodian visitors to take away from experiencing Indonesian food, music and culture during this event? The close ties between Indonesia and Cambodia go beyond what many may realise. Often, Cambodians may not even recognise that they are already enjoying elements of Indonesian culture — whether savouring Nasi Goreng while listening to Bengawan Solo or enjoying a plate of Indomie to the rhythm of Dangdut music. Indonesian culture has long been present in Cambodia, quietly embraced and enjoyed. The embassy has also noticed a rising interest among Cambodian youth in learning the Indonesian language, highlighting how Indonesia is becoming increasingly appealing to the younger generation. Through Phsaar Reatrei Indonesia, we hope to share not only the flavours and rhythms of Indonesia but also the spirit of harmony that unites our two nations. May this event will foster friendship, cultural exchange and mutual respect, creating opportunities to further strengthen the bond between our peoples.",

            "content": "Despite controversy, political tensions and personal hardship, Fiyata Neary Socheata, Miss Universe Cambodia 2025, has emerged as one of the most inspiring figures to have represented the Kingdom on the international stage. A multi-talented single mother who has shouldered triumph and adversity, Fiyata now deservedly stands as a symbol of national pride. Her departure from Phnom Penh for Thailand on November 2 was marked by hundreds of supporters who gathered to send her off in what she described as a deeply emotional milestone. “It was a truly unforgettable moment as I officially departed from the magnificent Techo International Airport, a remarkable new symbol of Cambodia’s pride and progress,” she said. “I've been waiting my whole life to see my name in lights. So now you're gonna know my name and the country I proudly represent.” “With every heartbeat, I carry the pride and love of my people,” she added. “This journey is not only mine — it’s ours, Cambodia.” Challenges at home and abroad Despite the warm send-off, Fiyata’s journey has been far from easy. Her path to Miss Universe has been shadowed by local pageantry controversies, emotional strain and political tensions between Cambodia and Thailand — the host nation of Miss Universe 2025. ELEVENTO9, the Miss Universe Cambodia licence holder, initially withdrew the Kingdom from the competition over political and safety concerns. Yet, determined and resolute, Fiyata continued independently — a decision requiring both emotional strength and personal sacrifice. As she packed her 30 suitcases in tears, one belief remained clear: “The international stage must have Cambodia’s flag and representative.” “I carry within me not just ambition, but gratitude for the lessons, for the growth, and for the strength that comes from believing in myself,” she reflected. Strong support from the pageant community International pageant analyst and commentator Luis Portelles discussed Fiyata’s performance and potential in a video published on his YouTube channel, where he reviewed Miss Universe Cambodia’s preparation and challenges. “You have to give it to Fiyata,” he said. “She has rhythm, stage presence, confidence — definitely a standout.” He also remarked on her communication skills. “One thing about her is that she is a strong storyteller. She knows how to answer effectively and connect her response back to herself. Even if her English isn't the most advanced, she uses her words wisely to present herself as a role model. That is very clever,” he noted. Portelles acknowledged external factors that could influence the competition. “All I can tell you is that she is deserving and capable. I do think she will do well. But now we are not only talking about the candidate herself — we are also talking about politics, not just pageant politics, but real-world politics. So we will see,” he added. A wave of national support Despite the controversies, Fiyata has earned overwhelming support from Cambodian public figures. Among them, rapper Tep Boprek, one of Cambodia’s most followed and influential music artists, contributed $1,000. “My friend, you are very strong… You’re amazing, beautiful, smart, strong and brave against the storm. I love you, Queen Fiyata,” he said, via social media. Lai Souyiek, a well-known cosmetics entrepreneur and owner of the Miss Sunflower brand, contributed $5,000. “We won’t ignore you, Fiyata. Please be strong. On behalf of Cambodian people, we support you and we are watching over you,” she said. The two are just two of the many more Cambodian influencers, artists, business owners and pageant supporters who have contributed financially and amplified public encouragement through content, livestreams, advocacy posts and rallying messages online — turning Fiyata’s journey into a national movement of solidarity. She described her tears and ‘sacrifices’ as she packed her 30 suitcases. Supplied A new era of representation Fiyata is among the first mothers to compete under, Miss Universe rule changes that now permit married women and mothers. Born Thai Nearysocheata, she made the conscious decision to change her name and reinforce her commitment to carrying Cambodia’s name with clarity, pride and dignity on the world stage. Her participation marks a transformative era for pageantry in Cambodia, symbolising the empowerment of women from all life stages. This year’s 74th Miss Universe edition in Thailand has unfolded amid heightened tension. The competition was overshadowed by a public confrontation involving pageant executive Nawat Itsaragrisil and Miss Universe Mexico, Fátima Bosch. The incident, which took place during a high-profile programme event, led to Miss Bosch walking out in protest, followed by several other contestants, including the reigning Miss Universe, in a visible show of solidarity. While many exited the venue, Fiyata chose to remain. Her decision, according to observers, appeared guided by diplomacy and cultural respect, with the aim of avoiding further escalation or tension between Cambodia and Thailand at a sensitive moment. The Miss Universe Organisation later issued a public statement condemning the incident and reaffirming its stance on the respect and protection of delegates. Nawat issued multiple apologies in response. In this environment, Fiyata’s calm conduct strengthened her image as a composed, grounded, and culturally sensitive representative — qualities often valued in both international diplomacy and pageantry. When several contestants walked out in solidarity with a disrespected contestant, Fiyata chose to remain in the interest of ‘avoiding further escalation or tension between Cambodia and Thailand’. Supplied Looking ahead The Miss Universe 2025 Coronation Night is scheduled for November 21, in Nonthaburi, Thailand. “I will give my very best to make Cambodia proud on the international stage — to let the world see our strength, beauty and spirit,” Fiyata said. Her journey — marked not by privilege, but by courage — has already positioned her as one of the strongest and most inspiring contestants Cambodia has ever sent to Miss Universe. Not simply a beauty queen, she is now a symbol of resilience, identity and national pride. The proud single mother has received financial support from many of the Kingdom’s most popular influencers and celebrities. Supplied",

            "content": "“I spent a lot of time there and the more time I spend, the more I fall in love,” Sovan Philong says of Avlatan, an isolated fishing village where he's spent months photographing a community living above water on a one-kilometre wooden bridge. His project is one of dozens on view at Photo Phnom Penh's 16th edition. But while the festival sprawls across galleries, embassies and cultural centres throughout the capital, some exhibitions demand more than a tuktuk circuit allows – they require understanding the artists' processes, their reasons for making images and the questions they're asking about photography itself. Three voices at this year's festival reveal how contemporary photographers are rethinking their medium's relationship to memory, place and community. Philong’s deep engagement with Avlatan. French photographer Letizia Le Fur's mythological reimagining of nature on the walls of the French Embassy. And curator Marie Le Mounier's vision for expanding what photography education can mean in Cambodia. Together they represent different approaches to a shared conviction: that photography can do more than document – it can transform how we see, remember and imagine our relationships with the world around us. Photo Phnom Penh has occupied a particular position in Southeast Asia's cultural landscape since 2008. It functions as a platform where European and Asian photographers exchange ideas, where emerging Cambodian artists find their voice and where different genres of photography collide and cross-pollinate. This year's programme spans decades, from Micheline Dullin's 1960s documentation of Phnom Penh under King Norodom Sihanouk to contemporary projects addressing climate change and community identity. The theme running through all exhibitions: photography's relationship to memory – what images preserve and what they reshape. Visitors gather inside the National Museum of Cambodia for the opening of Micheline Dullin’s exhibition, featuring her 1960s photographs documenting Phnom Penh during the Prince Norodom Sihanouk era. IFC/Photo Phnom Penh Excavating the city's past At the National Museum of Cambodia – hosting the festival for the first time – Dullin's photographs offer a window into a Phnom Penh that exists now only in these frames. As official photographer to Prince Sihanouk from 1958 to 1964, she documented the capital's major construction projects: the Olympic Stadium designed by architect Vann Molyvann, the Japanese Bridge, the development along the Bassac waterfront. Her aerial views preserve buildings that have since vanished, including the White Building, that iconic apartment complex abandoned under the Khmer Rouge regime. What distinguishes Dullin's work from standard architectural records is her attention to the human element. Even when individuals appear dwarfed by construction's scale, her lens remains attentive to workers, inhabitants and daily rhythms unfolding in the shadow of Cambodia's modernist ambitions. She used to say, “One should not define oneself as a photographer 'of'. One is a photographer.” In 1960s Phnom Penh, working in a profession rarely embraced by women, Dullin simply was the photographer. Her images establish a baseline for this year's festival – a moment when the city was building itself into a modern capital, before the rupture of the Khmer Rouge years. They set the terms for what follows: how do we document, remember and reimagine places and communities through the camera's eye? A visitor studies one of Micheline Dullin’s works on view at the National Museum of Cambodia, reflecting her distinctive eye for the city’s people and changing landscape. IFC/Photo Phnom Penh Art as community archive For Sovan Philong, preservation takes a different form. As president of the Photo Phnom Penh Association and director of Studio Images/Maison de la Photographie – the first school in Phnom Penh dedicated entirely to photography – he approaches the medium as both artistic practice and community service. His current project, part of the Métis exhibition at the French Institute, emerges from months spent in Avlatan, an isolated fishing village accessible only by boat, where a one-kilometre network of wooden bridges connects houses, a school and the pagoda, all above the waters of the Gulf of Thailand. The Métis Fund, created by the French Development Agency (AFD), commissioned three Cambodian artists – Philong, video artist Khiev Kanel and performer Khun Vannak – to explore humanity's relationship with the ocean. What began as an artistic residency evolved into something more complex: workshops with children, archival photography projects with families and an attempt to use art as a catalyst for community development. “At the beginning it was quite difficult because we didn't really know the feeling of the place,” Philong recalls. He had passed through the village two years earlier and found the bridge system intriguing, but living there revealed layers of isolation and intimacy that couldn't be captured in a single visit. “When you stay there more than two days, you feel really disconnected from society. If you don't use your smartphone, you don't have internet. You live just like them.” The rhythm of the village shaped his approach. Women cooking at home, children walking to school, boats departing for night fishing, the changing quality of light across water and wood. Philong's photographs organise themselves around three focal points: life inside the houses, views through windows and doors that frame how residents see the sea and the ambient light that defines different times of day and weather conditions. Visitors look closely at Sovan Philong’s photographs of daily life in Avlatan, where he spent months documenting the rhythms of a village suspended above the sea on a network of wooden bridges. IFC/Photo Phnom Penh But simple photography wasn't enough. “I really wanted to bring out the story of these villagers,” Philong explains. “Most tourists pass by and don't understand anything about how the inhabitants live – they buy food, they buy souvenirs, then they leave. They don't know the conditions, the stories.” The artistic intervention brought unexpected changes to Avlatan. Children learned performance, storytelling, photography, painting. One evening, the team projected everything the kids had created and parents who had never seen their children's work on screen gathered to watch. “For the parents, it was amazing,” Philong says. The experience revealed possibilities beyond traditional fishing and recycling occupations. “When you teach through art, the kids understand more easily. They feel something. And that feeling is what can make change.” Philong plans to return early next year to establish a permanent art centre in one of the village's empty houses – a space where young people could learn English, computer skills, photography and traditional arts. “Many speak Thai because they are close to the Thai border, but they are Cambodian,” Philong notes. “So we must think about identity. Art can help them feel their tradition, their identity, their significance.” “The voice of the media is very important – it can transform these places, bring them an audience,” he adds. “The village has its own smell, its own feeling – like cooking behind the houses, the boats coming right to the front door. That is the identity of the village. I spent a lot of time there and the more time I spend, the more I fall in love.” That process of falling in love through extended attention distinguishes Philong's work from tourism or even traditional documentary photography. He's not extracting images; he's building relationships, infrastructure, futures. The photographs become records of that exchange – evidence that art can reshape what communities imagine for themselves. Philong’s Avlatan project explores the interplay of light, movement and the quiet routines that define everyday life in the community. IFC/Photo Phnom Penh Nature as mythology On the outer walls of the French Embassy, French photographer Letizia Le Fur presents “Mythologies,” a series that approaches nature through a radically different lens – one borrowed from ancient tales and refracted through contemporary ecological anxiety. For Le Fur, myth provides a particular freedom. “Myth allows me to speak about the present without becoming didactic,” she explains. “It's a flexible, poetic form that can hold our fears, our hopes and our contradictions. By invoking these very ancient stories, I'm reminding us that our bond with the living world is nothing new: it has always been shaped by fascination, unease and a desire to understand.” Le Fur's work moves through three movements: “The Origin” evokes primordial chaos through mineral landscapes and telluric forces; “The Golden Age” celebrates nature awakening in shimmering frescoes of regained harmony; “The Metamorphoses” explores transformation and instability. Her photographs, processed to intensify colors and light until they “tip into another dimension”, reject photography's documentary function in favour of a poetic space where reflection on the present takes shape. First trained as a painter at the École des Beaux-Arts in Tours, Le Fur brings that sensibility to her photographic practice. “When I photograph, I think in terms of masses, colours, rhythms. I look for a kind of balance, but a living balance, one that could shift at any moment,” she says. “The post-production – very manual – extends that pictorial gesture. It's not retouching to smooth things out; it's a way of shaping the visual material, almost as one would with paint.” Letizia Le Fur’s outdoor installation “Mythologies” draws crowds to the walls of the French Embassy, where her reimagined landscapes reframe nature through colour, metaphor and mythic imagination. IFC/Photo Phnom Penh Her choice to address ecological themes through beauty rather than alarm is deliberate. “Beauty can be an entry point into complexity, without overwhelming the viewer with anxiety. I don't aim to denounce or to moralise; I try to create images where one can linger, breathe, feel something,” Le Fur says. “It may sound a bit naïve, but I do believe that enchantment can shift perspectives in its own quiet way.” The choice of the embassy walls carries particular resonance. During the chaos following the Khmer Rouge takeover of Phnom Penh, those walls sheltered hundreds of people. Now they host images of transfigured landscapes that function as mirrors held up to our times – an invitation to rethink relationships with nature, to question our fears and to imagine possible futures. Le Fur didn't create the series specifically for the embassy, but designed the installation knowing the works would be shown outdoors. “I imagined a living scenography with shifting scales: some prints very large, almost monumental, others more intimate. I like this alternation because it creates a rhythm as people walk by.” The outdoor setting means the images blend with their surroundings, shaped by the city, daylight and architectural constraints. “What I enjoy is that the images keep living beyond me,” she says. Where Philong's work roots itself in a specific community over months of patient engagement, Le Fur's operates through suggestion and metaphor. Both approaches, however, share a belief that photography can do more than document – it can transform how we see, remember and imagine our relationships with the world around us. Photo Phnom Penh’s public programmes bridge artists, curators and audiences, underscoring the festival’s role as both exhibition platform and educational hub. IFC/Photo Phnom Penh Expanding the frame Behind the exhibitions, Photo Phnom Penh functions as artistic infrastructure. Studio Images/Maison de la Photographie, opened just a year ago by the association, now welcomes around twenty young Cambodians learning not just technical skills but ways of seeing. Marie Le Mounier, one of the festival's curators alongside Beat Streuli and the late Christian Caujolle, sees this breadth as essential. “In Cambodia it's important to present a variety of time frames, supports, media and approaches, because access to culture is more limited,” she explains. “In Paris or elsewhere in Europe we have many museums, festivals, magazines, blogs – everything. So a broader content and larger approach make sense.” The connection between festival and school runs deeper than administrative convenience. “The idea of having the festival attached to the school, or made by the same association, is that we create links between the two,” Le Mounier explains. “In the Global North we have specialised schools for teaching and learning arts or photography. In Cambodia there's not such broad access to photography education. So if we are restrictive in what we're presenting – if we just do artistic photography – then we miss the point.” Photography, she argues, isn't like painting. “It's not just fine art, it's also media. Students are training in both. They're interested in several branches of photography, and they need to learn practical skills because they need to make a living.” Next year she'd like to include an exhibition on fashion. The festival becomes a teaching tool, exposing students to the full spectrum of what their medium can be. Her approach to curating reflects this philosophy. “For me the dialogue between past and present is always important,” she says. “We tend to think of the present and future only in terms of progress, and that isn't always the best approach. We can learn from the past. As the historian Marc Bloch argued, you solve problems in the present by knowing the past.” This year's edition marks a transition that acknowledges both continuity and change. Caujolle, who had curated the festival since 2008, passed away in October. A former director of Agence VU', the legendary photo agency, and the figure who introduced art photography to the French daily Libération in the late 1980s, Caujolle shaped the event's identity for over fifteen years. This year he worked alongside Le Mounier and Streuli as part of a curatorial team – a shift from the festival's previous model of a single curator. “We're moving from a long period when a single curator led the programme to a broader curatorial team,” Le Mounier explains. “Along with that change, we must include Cambodian curatorial voices – or at least Southeast Asian curators. It cannot be only Western curators. That's a priority going forward.” Over the coming months, she and Streuli plan to open a seminar on the festival's future, involving Cambodian artists, curators and Studio Images students in those discussions. This year's selection of Cambodian artists emerged from recent projects that broaden what photography can encompass. “We selected three people who had just completed projects in collaboration with AFD. The projects were new and broad: Khun Vannak works between documentary and fiction; Khiev Kanel works with video-surveillance cameras; another project addresses family memories from the Khmer Rouge era. Together they broaden the audience's idea of what photography can be – documenting performance, interrogating surveillance, or more traditional approaches – which is inspiring for young photographers and students.” Le Mounier herself will lead a December workshop on photography history, teaching not through lectures but through practice. “If we discuss the view camera, students will use a view camera,” she says. “It's practical and experimental rather than purely theoretical.” What remains What emerges from conversations with Philong, Le Fur and Le Mounier is an understanding of photography that extends beyond individual artistic vision and toward something more sustained and reciprocal. Whether Dullin spending hours alongside construction workers in the 1960s, Le Fur intensifying natural landscapes into mythological spaces, or Philong returning repeatedly to a fishing village until its rhythms become familiar – the work requires duration, patience, reciprocity. Photo Phnom Penh positions itself at these intersections: between historical archives and contemporary creation, between documentary and fiction, between transmission and reinvention. The festival asks how images shape perception and memory, how they allow us to depict the world and potentially act upon it. In a city still processing its traumatic history while facing uncertain environmental and economic futures, these questions carry particular weight. December 19 marks the festival's official close, although some exhibitions continue into January. The real work, though, extends far beyond any closing date. Philong will return to Avlatan to establish that art centre. Le Mounier and Streuli will convene their seminar on the festival's future. The photographs will remain. The children who learned to see their village through cameras will remember what it felt like when their work appeared on screen. The archives grow richer, and the conversation between past, present and future continues.",

            "content": "For years, the Ministry of Education has issued repeated directives banning junk food and sugary drinks in schools. In late November, it released yet another instruction—this time responding to Prime Minister Hun Manet’s call to tighten restrictions on energy drinks on school grounds. At first glance, this seems like a decisive move to protect children’s health amid rising non-communicable diseases. But this is far from the first ban, and a walk through classrooms and schoolyards reveals a very different reality. I keep raising this issue because these directives point to one simple truth: without real enforcement, oversight, and meaningful nutrition education, a directive is nothing more than paper meant to give the illusion of progress. In practice, vendors both inside school compounds and just outside the gates continue to sell soft drinks, instant noodles, deep-fried snacks, brightly colored meatballs of unknown origin, and a range of sugary treats. These foods are cheap, tasty, and addictive. Even as an adult, I sometimes struggle to resist them. This happens because schools lack the systems and capacity to monitor compliance and hold vendors accountable. Many schools—especially in rural provinces—do not have the resources or structures needed to consistently supervise students or vendors. One viral social media clip showed a primary school student filling her water bottle with an energy drink, fooling her teacher into thinking it was water. In Phnom Penh, a primary school vendor has gained TikTok fame for comedic videos selling junk food to children, offering everything from instant noodles and hot-dog sandwiches to rice and eggs drenched in sweetened dipping sauce. All of this raises an important question: does the government truly prioritize children’s health, or is it cultivating the appearance of a strong policy? The truth is that it is common for governments to issue guidelines that look proactive but lack clear plans or practical implementation. Without funding, training, monitoring, and support on the ground, these measures remain symbolic. If we fail to call out these gaps and demand real action, the cycle will continue. As energy drinks and junk food become a growing part of children’s diets, the costs will fall on the next generation—and eventually strain the health system and slow development. A school may officially prohibit sugary drinks, but the deeper problem lies elsewhere: there is no budget for teacher training, no assistance for vendors to provide healthier alternatives, and no clear enforcement structure. Teachers are left to enforce rules without proper guidance, while vendors continue selling banned items because the policy threatens their income unless support mechanisms are built in. Meanwhile, children from low-income families have limited choices and naturally gravitate toward whatever is cheapest. Education on balanced diets is also essential. Simply telling children to stop eating the foods they love will never work if they don’t understand why those foods are harmful. Even with a ban, many will still buy the same snacks at home or from nearby markets. Without consistent lessons on nutrition and healthy habits, behavior change is unlikely to occur. Still, the government deserves credit for endorsing the School Feeding Transition Strategy , which aims for full national ownership of the National Home-Grown School Feeding Program (NHGSF) by 2028. Cambodia has also joined the School Meals Coalition and plans to improve school meal quality by 2026. As of January 2025, Cambodia had completed 65 percent of the transition, according to the Global Nutrition Report. The country also plans to ensure minimum nutrition standards for students and incorporate fortified rice into at least 10 percent of all school meals. The Ministry of Education bans a long list of items: expired food; alcohol and tobacco products; food of unknown origin; energy drinks; sugary beverages; coffee; ice cream; syrup; chocolate; candy; all types of chewing gum; and jellies, donuts, sweet cakes, and sweetened canned fruits. Some schools have already taken steps toward healthier environments. Siem Reap’s Wat Bo Primary School, for example, provides Khmer cakes, fresh fruits, bobor (Khmer porridge), rice, and Khmer noodles instead of sugary snacks and energy drinks. What Can Cambodia Learn from the Region? Around the world, malnutrition remains a major concern , prompting many countries to adopt school-based health and nutrition programs. Singapore stands out in ASEAN for its strong regulation of unhealthy food in schools. Its Healthy Meals in Schools Programme (HMSP) , launched in 2011, increases access to healthier food options through collaboration among teachers, canteen vendors, students, the Health Promotion Board, and the Ministry of Education. Participating vendors are required to reduce fat, sugar, and sodium while incorporating whole grains, fruits, and vegetables into meals. They also offer nutritious set menus. Nutritionists commissioned by the Health Promotion Board conduct regular compliance checks, provide educational materials for students, and give guidance to vendors. To help vendors meet standards without sacrificing income, schools charge low rental fees —between $5 and $15 per month during the school term—and waive rent during holidays. The Ministry of Education also negotiates favorable electricity rates through demand aggregation, passing savings on to stallholders. Malaysia introduced Healthy School Canteen Guidelines in 2011 as well, but weak implementation and limited vendor cooperation continue to undermine progress. Japan’s School Food Program takes a more integrated approach, combining nutrition education with meal provision . Diet and Nutrition Teachers oversee meal standards and teach nutrition, strengthening the program’s effectiveness. Centralized kitchens ensure quality and consistency. The government subsidizes meals, and by 2023, 40 percent of municipalities offered free lunches, with plans to further expand free meals for low-income families. These examples offer valuable lessons for Cambodia as it seeks practical ways to enforce a junk food ban. There is no single model that fits every context, but the real challenge lies in consistency and genuine commitment. The ban is only a starting point; it must be supported with strong enforcement, sustained education, and an environment that makes healthier choices accessible and appealing. Children need a food policy that delivers real results—not another round of promises that fail to change anything.",

            "content": "PHNOM PENH – Unilateral investigations of landmine explosions without bilateral consultation erode Article 8 of the Ottawa Convention and undermine trust among State Parties, Cambodian Ambassador In Dara has told the UN. This was politicizing the narrative away from being a humanitarian matter. Under the topic “Preventing and Suppressing Prohibited Activities and Facilitating Compliance”, In Dara, Permanent Representative of Cambodia to the United Nations Office in Geneva, spoke at the Meeting of the States Parties to the Ottawa Convention on Dec. 4 in Geneva. The ambassador raised allegations by Thailand against Cambodia about “newly emplaced mines”. He said incidents occurred on Cambodian territory, based on maps produced under the 1904 and 1907 Treaties and reaffirmed in the 2000 memorandum of understanding. “Thailand's so-called evidence is entirely unilateral, produced without permitting Cambodia or neutral experts accessing to the sites,” Dara said. “Such opacity falls far below any standard of scientific credibility or good-faith cooperation. Claims that cannot withstand independent scrutiny cannot credibly form the basis of a compliance allegation under this Convention.” The ambassador said this was not a narrative competition, but a matter of method. Cambodia wanted the transparency and shared investigation to seek the truth in humanitarian disarmament, not from unilateral assertion. “Compliance assessments under this Convention must be guided by verifiable evidence, objective analysis and cooperative verification,” Dara said. Cambodia considered the Ottawa Convention not only a treaty of prohibitions but also a collective ethical compact. “It affirms that the remnants of war must not be permitted to outlast the conflicts that produced them and that weapons incapable of distinguishing between combatant and civilian have no place in any rules-based international order,” Dara said. These principles are the lived realities for Cambodia, a country that has been hurt economically and socially by landmines and remnants of war. The country adhered to the Convention due to its experience, moral conviction and the understanding of humanitarian law’s role in protecting people. It was not an instrument of political convenience. The ambassador expressed concern over Thailand’s persistent attempts to politicize the Convention’s compliance mechanisms to advance extraneous political and territorial aims. This was the opposite of the mechanisms’ duty to safeguard the Convention, not as leverage in disputes or strategic messaging. “No state party should permit such distortion,” Dara said. In responding to the landmine accusation, Cambodia has provided clarity and evidence with technical detail, historical context and precise geographical data, which were in a comprehensive clarification document submitted to the UN Secretary-General. “This reaffirms our unbroken record as a principled, constructive and cooperative State Party,” he said. The ambassador said politicizing such a matter erodes the integrity of Article 8, which undermines the mutual trust among State Parties and risks transforming a humanitarian regime into a forum for strategic manipulation. “If left unchecked, it would weaken the Convention for all States Parties, compromising its impartiality, legitimacy and humanitarian character,” Dara said. Article 8, the ambassador continued, was to foster trust, not suspicion, and to require cooperation, not confrontation. It was not a shortcut for unilateral accusation or political maneuvering. According to Article 8(1), States Parties “agree to consult and cooperate with each other regarding the implementation of the provisions of this Convention, and to work together in a spirit of cooperation to facilitate compliance by States Parties with their obligations under this Convention.” Meanwhile, article 8(2) says, “If one or more States Parties wish to clarify and seek to resolve questions relating to compliance with the provisions of this Convention by another State Party, it may submit, through the Secretary-General of the United Nations, a Request for Clarification of that matter to that State Party. Such a request shall be accompanied by all appropriate information. “Each State Party shall refrain from unfounded requests for clarification, care being taken to avoid abuse. A State Party that receives a request for clarification shall provide, through the Secretary-General of the United Nations, within 28 days to the requesting State Party all information which would assist in clarifying this matter.” The ambassador said, “Thailand's invocation of Article 8(2) without discharging its obligations under Article 8(1) first constitutes a deliberate instrumentalization of the Convention's compliance tools for purposes wholly unrelated to mine action.” Such an inversion departs from the Convention’s legal sequence and replaces fact-based inquiry with adversarial positioning. The ambassador called out Thailand for abusing the process. “Cambodia rejects such misuse,” Dara said. “Humanitarian disarmament is sustained not by political expediency but by principled conduct.” The ambassador recalled that the Convention authority depends on the integrity of its processes, the accuracy of its evidence and the good-faith conduct of its States Parties. Cambodia, with the history of suffering from landmines and legal responsibilities, wants no community to endure such misery. The ambassador urged all State Parties to “defend the Convention against politicization, uphold the procedural and evidentiary integrity of Article 8, and ensure that compliance deliberations remain firmly grounded in truth, cooperation and the humanitarian purpose that inspired this treaty.” Cambodia reaffirmed its readiness to engage constructively, transparently, and accordingly with the principles in the Convention.",

            "content": "PHNOM PENH – With global momentum behind the landmine ban under strain, Cambodia has stepped forward once again to help steer international action, co-drafting a new UN resolution urging states to join the Ottawa Convention and strengthen support for mine victims worldwide. Prepared jointly by Japan—current president of the 22nd Meeting of States Parties—alongside Cambodia, last year’s chair, and Zambia, which will assume the presidency next year, the draft resolution was adopted by 159 UN member states on December 1, reaffirming a collective commitment to eliminating anti-personnel mines and the suffering they continue to inflict. According to Japan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the measure calls on all non-party states to accede to the Convention without delay and stresses that its impact depends on full, effective compliance. It urges governments and partners to expand victim assistance, rehabilitation and social reintegration programs, as well as intensify mine-risk education, mine-reduction efforts, and the destruction of stockpiled or newly discovered mines. The statement noted that comprehensive action is essential to address the continued threat posed by anti-personnel mines. Border Tensions Cast a Shadow Over Cambodia–Thailand Ties The renewed global push comes as landmines have resurfaced as a volatile flashpoint in the Cambodia–Thailand border dispute. Thai officials have repeatedly accused Cambodia of laying new mines in violation of the Convention—an allegation Phnom Penh dismisses as politically driven and unsupported by evidence. Tensions flared in mid-July when three Thai soldiers were injured by mine explosions along the frontier. Bangkok claimed the devices had been freshly planted by Cambodian forces, prompting sharp exchanges between the two sides. Cambodia rejected the allegations as “baseless” and called for an impartial, evidence-based investigation. Cambodian authorities, noting the country remains one of the world’s most heavily mine-affected, have urged Thailand to pursue a jointly verified inquiry or use existing bilateral mechanisms to clarify the incident. A more recent case involved a Chinese national, identified by Thai authorities as Shi Jingui, who reportedly stepped on a mine near the border. Thailand said he had crossed from Cambodia; Phnom Penh countered that no such name appears in its immigration database. Global Retreat From the Mine Ban Treaty Raises Alarm The Ottawa Convention—formally the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on Their Destruction—was adopted in 1997 and entered into force in 1999. It currently has 166 States Parties. Cambodia, which hosted the Fifth Review Conference of the Convention in Siem Reap in November 2024—the first Asian country to do so—has been a vocal advocate for universalizing the treaty and accelerating clearance of legacy minefields. But the international landscape is shifting. Major powers including the United States, Russia and China remain outside the Convention. After Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the United States supplied Kyiv with anti-personnel mines in 2024 as part of its military assistance—widely seen as contradicting the treaty’s norms. As the war dragged on, Ukraine signaled its own departure from the global ban. In June, President Volodymyr Zelensky signed a decree initiating withdrawal; the proposal is now before the Ukrainian parliament. Security anxieties in Europe have driven others to consider similar steps. In early June, the parliaments of Finland and Poland approved proposals to leave the treaty, with formal withdrawal instruments expected soon. On June 27, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania deposited their withdrawal documents with the UN; their exit will take effect six months after submission.",

He also highlighted the recent growth in trade, which he said reflects the political and diplomatic commitment of both governments. Canada established diplomatic relations with Cambodia in 1953. In early 2025, Canada upgraded its diplomatic presence in the country by opening a full embassy staffed with a resident ambassador. The decision followed a pledge by former Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau during the 2024 ASEAN Summit in Vientiane. In 2024, total merchandise trade between the two countries reached $2.4 billion, up from $2.1 billion in 2023. Cambodia’s imports from Canada totaled 33.4 million dollars in 2024, down from $37.2 million in 2023. In the same year, Canadian direct investment in Cambodia amounted to $2.9 billion.

The company, Cambodian Xuan Yi Minerals Co., Ltd., is located in Toek Phos district. The decision followed an investigation into reports of contaminated water in the O’Russei area on Dec. 5. Environment Ministry spokesperson Khvay Atitya said that the company had violated environmental laws by improperly discharging chemical liquid waste into the O’Russei water system, affecting Khlong Popoak, Chieb and Taing Krasaing communes in Toek Phos district. The company used a natural pond as a storage site for liquid waste without installing a treatment system, he said. Wastewater from its mining operations was then released into the regular drainage network. Atitya added that the company also lacked proper storage for solid waste and hazardous substances, and had failed to conduct an environmental impact assessment in line with the Environment and Natural Resources Code. Legal action will be taken against the firm, he said. To prevent health risks, the ministry has advised residents living along the O’Russei water system to temporarily stop using water from the area. They were also urged to suspend fishing and to avoid letting livestock drink the water until further notice. Water pollution linked to mining is not new in Cambodia. Only weeks ago, Mongabay published an investigative report revealing that an unregulated gold mine operating upstream inside Virachey National Park in Ratanakiri province had caused severe water contamination. Communities along the O’Ta Bouk River reported skin ailments, while fish stocks collapsed due to polluted water, according to the report. Moeu Chandara, president of the Cambodian Youth Network, said that pollution caused by industrial operations has long been a concern, but the authorities often take action only after cases become public. There have been previous incidents involving mining and industrial companies that discharged contaminated water into natural waterways, harming both ecosystems and human health, he said. Chandara urged the ministry to conduct timely and targeted monitoring of companies that use or dispose of chemical substances. The ministry moving beyond reacting to reported cases and instead taking more proactive enforcement measures would deter violations and help prevent pollution before it occurs, he said. Chandara called for regular spot checks and assessments of industrial operations, including inspections of waste storage tanks and treatment systems, to better protect communities. “What I want to see is strict and comprehensive enforcement of regulations, and close cooperation with stakeholders to hold violators accountable and prevent future pollution,” Chandara said. “The authorities take action only when people report problems,” he said. “What about the unreported cases elsewhere that we do not know about? Who is responsible for the environmental and public health costs of this mismanagement?” Chandara added that a consistent and robust monitoring system is crucial to protect public health and safeguard people’s way of life in the country.",

            "content": "SIEM REAP — The fifth Angkor Thanksgiving Ceremony will be held from Dec. 14 through 16, three days during which religious leaders, Buddhist devotees, heritage experts and the public will gather in the Angkor Archaeological Park where an empire’s capital stood centuries ago with its monuments, waterways and infrastructure, and still stands today as a UNESCO World Heritage site, benefitting the country. Several religious ceremonies will be conducted during these three days in areas near the Angkor Wat, Phnom Bakheng and Bayon temples. Sim Bunthoeun (left), deputy director of the Department of Land and Habitat Management in Angkor Park. As Sim Bunthoeun, deputy director of the Department of Land and Habitat Management in Angkor Park, explained, the Thanksgiving Ceremony is to begin on Dec. 14, marking the 33rd anniversary of Angkor Park being inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage list, which had taken place on Dec. 14, 1992, in Santa Fe city in United States. As Bunthoeun explained, while this will only be the fifth year that the Angkor Thanksgiving Ceremony is held, ceremonies to express Cambodians’ gratitude to their ancestors have been conducted for a very, very long time. Angkor Thanksgiving can be considered a continuation of the tradition, he said. Records found at the Preah Khan temple in Angkor Park and dating from the 12th century revealed that a nationwide Buddhist procession was held for which Buddhist statues were brought in from many corners of the empire, with the event attended by delegations and monarchs from neighbouring nations. At the 12th century Banteay Chhmar temple in Banteay Meanchey province, Buddhist processions are depicted on the bas-reliefs sculpted on the walls of the temple. Moreover, records from post-Angkorian periods refer to members of the royal families making offerings at Angkor Wat temple. The Thanksgiving Ceremony held this year on Dec. 14 through 16, Bunthoeun said, will include, among other events, an almsgiving ceremony in the morning of the first day in which will take part 133 monks in front of the Angkor Wat temple, and a procession during which Buddhist statues will be taken from Angkor Wat to the Preah Ang Ngok pagoda just north of the Bayon temple. Eight of the statues will be from the other regions of Cambodia and one from the Angkor region. During the second day, a meditation session will take place in front of the mountain temple of Phnom Bakheng during the afternoon, presided over by Venerable Pin Sem, a highly-respected head monk of Reach Bo pagoda in Siem Reap city—meditation is one of the many important practices in Buddhism. On the third day, Buddhist statues from the Preah Ang Ngok pagoda at Angkor will be bathed in the course of ceremonies and traditional celebrations. Phon Noy, a tourism agent of the Apsara National Authority at the Angkor Wat temple. As he was discussing the upcoming events at Angkor, Phon Noy, who is a tourism agent of the Apsara National Authority—the government agency overseeing Angkor Park—at the Angkor Wat temple, explained that he felt a family connection with the temples. “Angkor is like an ancestor who has always been here to look after his descendants,” he said. “At the same time, we are like the children and grandchildren of the temples who in turn look after the temples as they get older and older.” Som Sopharath, director of the Department of Conservation of Monuments and Preventive Archaeology at the Apsara National Authority. “Remembering the deeds of Angkor is equal to remembering the deeds of our nation,” said Som Sopharath, director of the Department of Conservation of Monuments and Preventive Archaeology at the Apsara National Authority. “For centuries, Angkor has been the efforts of many monarchs, countless builders, and restorers from within Cambodia and abroad who spent years risking their lives and investing their time to create, protect, preserve and study Angkor,” he said. “This is why we must remember and honour their names.” Neth Simon, an archaeologist with the Apsara National Authority. Neth Simon, an archaeologist with the Apsara National Authority, also deeply appreciates the wealth and legacy the Khmer ancestors have left for their descendants. Having worked on the restoration of temples for many years, Simon said she still cannot fully comprehend how such massive monuments could be constructed centuries ago with a precision and consistency that keep on amazing researchers. “Although these temples have experienced centuries of weathering, they are still benefitting their children in terms of tourism, national identity, and scientific studies,” she said. “This is why we need to show our gratitude for what they have done.” ______________________ Ky Soklim, Sem Vanna, Heng Sreylin, and Ky Chamna contributed to the story.",

            "content": "PHNOM PENH – National and international HIV advocates have praised Cambodia’s efforts in the battle against HIV/AIDS. They singled out the launch this year of two prevention options, known as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). One is the injectable Cabotegravir drug. The other is the dapivirine vaginal ring which is used internally and releases the antiretroviral drug dapivirine. New options are expected to be introduced if these are effective. Celebrating the World AIDS Day on Dec. 1, Cambodia was praised for accomplishments this year for its leading policies and activities in responding to HIV prevention and treatments. Cambodia has achieved 92-100-98 targets compared to the UNAIDS 95-95-95 targets. This means 95 percent of people living with HIV (PLHIV) knowing their status, 95 percent of those receiving treatment, and 95 percent achieving viral suppression (U=U status, meaning an undetectable virus cannot be transmitted). However, further efforts are on the way to reduce new infections to fewer than 200 a year. These include commitment, human and financial resources, additional strategies and new PrEP options. In an interview with National TV (TVK), Dr. Ouk Vichea, director of the National Centre for HIV/AIDS Dermatology and STDs (NCHADS), said 300 to 400 people were using the injectable PrEP Cambodianess tried contacting NCHADS for the number of people who use DVR but did not receive any response by press time. However, Dr. Vichea reaffirmed the commitment to “introducing new options for HIV prevention to the country if there is new, convenient and safe prevention method established globally”. “AIDS is not over yet. Prevention must be conducted,” he said. “Testing and PEP (post-exposure prophylaxis) must be considered if someone suspects they have been exposed to HIV.” UNAIDS Cambodia addressed three major challenges, the capability to reduce infections to fewer than 200 a year, persistent stigma and discrimination and declining international funding The organization urged stakeholders to secure sustainable financing, community empowerment, innovation expansion (PrEP, self-testing and long-acting prevention), barrier removal and human rights adherence, and health system resilience “Together, we can overcome disruptions and transform the AIDS response. Let’s act with urgency, unity, and commitment to end AIDS by 2030,” it said Dr. Vichea said Cambodia must prepare additional strategies amid the decline of funding while maintaining successful results to avoid setbacks. Success Depends on Key Populations Seum Sophal, HIV advocate from the Health Action Coordinating Committee (HACC), commended the new PrEP launches, hoping the options will help key populations preventing infection. The advocate noted the positive impacts of the options, as some people who have shifted from PrEP medicines to injectable PrEP. However, some turned to medicines again after the injectable PrEP due to discomfort about injection. Sophal applauded Cambodia for successfully launching new HIV/AIDS prevention options this year, because the country has provided multiple means in addition to condoms and regular testing. The country is also able to grasp the number of vulnerable and key populations on whom authorities should follow up for testing and treatment. However, success depends on financial and human resources and the most important contribution is the commitment from the key populations. “Another challenge is to reach out to people in higher classes whose reputation is important and who still self-discriminate and not seek treatments,” he said. “Some cannot accept it even if the reach-out workers inform them.” Men who have sex with men (MSM) still account for the biggest number of infections, Sophal suggested that their participation in prevention must be encouraged but it has to be without stigma and discrimination. “Using the peer-to-peer approach, they feel more comfortable being educated through their friends or people in the LGBTQ communities, and that is one of the most efficient ways to prevent new infections,” Sophal said.",

            "content": "Ethnic Vietnamese people living in a popular Siem Reap tourist destination say dozens of families in their community have fled in the last year, spurred by an illegal fishing crackdown that saw dozens of boats confiscated and ongoing alleged extortion by the local Vietnamese association. A minority group that receives regular vitriol from the rest of the country, ethnic Vietnamese are estimated to make up around 400,000 in Cambodia but largely lack citizenship, meaning they cannot own property or use public services even if they were born in Cambodia. Many live in floating homes around the Tonle Sap and fish for a living. In Siem Reap’s Chong Khneas village, below the hill of Phnom Kraom along the edge of the Tonle Sap, ethnic Vietnamese families have lived for decades in small, colorful houseboats, operating a robust fishing economy. The families migrate to the middle of the lake during the dry season and dock closer to the shore during the wet season. Tourists pay for boat rides around the shoreline. Kids grow up speaking Vietnamese and Khmer. But in recent years, fast-disappearing fish populations in the Tonle Sap have caused the community to dwindle from a peak of about 1,000 families to around 300. Now pressure from local and national authorities — and the local ethnic Vietnamese association that is meant to serve as their advocate to the country’s Khmer majority — has prompted another 70 families to flee to Vietnam in the last eight months alone, residents say, shrinking Chong Khneas to about 230 ethnic Vietnamese households and putting a pall of fear over those that remain. Floating homes in Siem Reap’s Chong Kneas commune. (Fiona Kelliher/VOD) Of the dozen or so ethnic Vietnamese residents that reporters met during a late January visit, only a few said they could speak about problems with authorities. All declined to provide their names, saying the village’s situation had deteriorated in the past year. “People don’t dare to speak out about what’s happening here,” said one elderly man. “Everyone is scared.” On a national level, the Khmer Vietnamese Association provides ethnic Vietnamese families with charity, arranges permanent residency cards and attends meetings with local officials — a majority of whom are Khmer — on residents’ behalf. But it plays a different role in Chong Khneas, colluding with local Khmer authorities to extort money from people and threatening or detaining those who fail to pay up. Residents allege that the local association charges $50 monthly per family to go fishing, whether they use illegal equipment or not. Those who cannot pay are forced to pay higher fines to the association leaders directly, and sometimes local authorities, lest they be accused of illegal fishing. One 44-year-old woman said that when her relative couldn’t afford the $50 charge for January, the association threatened to confiscate his boat. Then they took him on shore, where he negotiated with commune authorities to accept a 500,000 riel or $121 “fine” when he came up with the money. The process repeats itself whenever someone can’t pay, which happens throughout the year, the residents said. Although they acknowledged that some residents are indeed fishing with illegal nets or equipment, the fee and threat of detainment apply regardless of whether people are breaking the law. “If you don’t pay, they’ll say, ‘You didn’t pay – let’s detain you,’” the elderly resident said. “And if you give them money, they’ll let you go free.” Association leaders have also allegedly warned residents against telling national authorities about the fee. Sim Chy, president of the national Khmer Vietnamese Association, declined to answer questions beyond saying that he did not know anything about the alleged fishing payments. Local Chong Khneas authorities also said they did not know but emphasized there should be no fees or licensing costs associated with subsistence fishing. Local village chief Soun Chhay, whose jurisdiction also covers the floating village, said he didn’t want to comment on ethnic Vietnamese affairs. “That’s their work and business which I don’t know about,” he said. “I don’t know what kind of tools they are using,” added commune chief Orm Nary, implying it was not uncommon for people to make unofficial payments to use illegal fishing equipment. “I can’t answer more about this. Why are they paying money?” A national illegal fishing crackdown has meanwhile put compounding pressure on the community. Starting last March, authorities from the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries raided villages around the Tonle Sap and confiscated fine-mesh fishing nets, electric shock equipment and boats that they said had underground trawlers to catch fish illegally. Of the roughly 50 boats confiscated in Chong Khneas during the initial raid, at least seven were legal motorboats people used for daily activities, sending fear through the rest of the community, residents said. “I don’t even know how to describe how it feels,” said fisher Ngouy Foerng soon after her family’s boat was confiscated last year. “The authorities took everything. Even the small nets, they confiscated.” Since the first raid, national authorities have returned thrice more and taken another 15 small boats, leaving roughly 70 families without their boats. The targeted crackdown on the minority group has led dozens of families to leave, either because they had their boats taken or were sick of paying the alleged extortion fees. Two more ethnic Vietnamese residents were arrested in August and remain in custody, residents said. Village chief Chhay confirmed the two arrests but would not share more details except saying that there had been nine more residents illegally fishing who escaped. A local school in Chong Khneas commune. (Fiona Kelliher/VOD) There are differing estimates of how many families live in Chong Khneas now. Residents interviewed in mid-January said there were no more than 230 families left. Local authorities said there were about 350 families. Chy, the national association president, said there could be as many as 400. Moving to Vietnam, however, is not an easy solution. Without citizenship papers from either country, people moving to Vietnam are confined to per-diem construction work, barred from more regulated jobs that would require identification and creating a boomerang effect between the two countries. Treng Yang Khorn, 62, who is ethnically Vietnamese and was born in Cambodia, has tried migrating to Vietnam a few times over the years when he struggled to fish enough in the drying lake. He inevitably found his way back to the Tonle Sap after a short period of time, and now he’d never consider permanently leaving the lake. “The hard part is the papers to get into the country, because without citizenship, you can’t really work in factories,” Yang Khorn said. In his supposed ancestral homeland, he was never able to find jobs except in the construction industry. “It was quite hard. When it rained, we had no money.” In fact, the 44-year-old woman whose relative couldn’t pay the monthly fishing fee said that four of her relatives had already tried moving to Vietnam once after the boat confiscations but had returned to Chong Khneas in recent weeks when they, too, failed to find steady jobs. She had wanted to join them but didn’t have the money to get there. “I’m talking to you because I want to get help,” she said. “I don’t want to get rich. I just want to have a normal life and not pay for everything.”",

            "content": "Ang Ra, 32, used to make a decent living driving groups of tourists around the floating village of Chong Khneas near Siem Reap. It wasn’t enough to make a lot of money, but Ra — who first learned to drive a tourist boat around his community’s waterways at the age of 12 — earned about $500 from about 40 rides per month, allowing him to pay another driver to manage his eight boats when he needed a day off. He hoped to hit that income stream again once Covid-19 travel restrictions eased. But starting last February, Angkor Enterprise, an arm of the Ministry of Tourism that oversees ticket sales at Angkor Archaeological Park, began managing the tourist system in Chong Khneas. The new system has tightened restrictions and stopped providing tips to local tour guides, causing tourists to seek similar services in a neighboring village and leaving boat drivers with fewer customers than they’d hoped to claw back from the pandemic, Ra and other residents say. “If [boat drivers] don’t have customers, they will go to find jobs in construction – and just keep the boat until it’s broken,” Ra said. The village comprises a long sliver of land where Khmer residents make a living from fishing and selling goods. Further out in the Tonle Sap itself, several hundred bobbing houseboats occupied mostly by ethnic Vietnamese villagers make up the “floating” village popular among tourists. On a recent morning at the entrance of Chong Khneas village, security guards milled around near a “STOP” sign outside a large checkpoint, directing tuk-tuks and trucks toward the Angkor Enterprise office. In the water below, about 300 wooden boats — some with eight seats, others up to 50 — sat docked waiting for passengers. Tourists filled one or two small boats at a time, carrying parasols and cameras. A fisher rides his boat on the Tonle Sap in Siem Reap’s Chong Khneas commune. (Fiona Kelliher/VOD) At face value, Angkor Enterprise runs the boat system the same as always: The roughly 110 families make up the community boat association, and who own roughly 300 boats among them, take turns driving groups of tourists around Chong Khneas. Prices have not shifted significantly, either. The smallest boat previously cost $14, plus $3 per person, whereas Angkor Enterprise rates now start at $28 — a small increase that is still a deterrent for local tourists. But less noticeable changes to the system have caused drivers to lose income, according to Chong Khneas village chief Soun Chhay. Angkor Enterprise has stopped giving out tips to tour guides coming to the community, prompting guides to instead bring their groups to the neighboring village of Kampong Phluk, located about an hour southeast by motorbike — where prices are also cheaper for local tourists. Angkor Enterprise has also proactively prevented boat owners who are not under the boat system’s administration from driving tourists around the village, cutting out a potential income stream for fishers who say they used to have more leeway to drive small groups of tourists. A driver himself, Chhay gets just two or three rides a month, not enough to scrape together a living. Even as tourism rebounds in Siem Reap, Chong Khneas sees 30 to 40 boat rides per day. “This is hard for the members, and we’ve asked for a solution [from Angkor Enterprise] but they haven’t responded yet,” Chhay said. “This impacts the people, as they can’t earn,” he added. In neighboring Kampong Phluk, the community boat association has operated the tourist system autonomously since the mid-2000s, according to longtime boat driver Pen Vy, growing its customer base as floating villages became an increasingly popular international tourist destination. Foreigners have to pay $25 per head to rent a boat, but local tourists can split the $25 price among up to seven people and rent freely from whoever they want, attracting a wider range of people, he said. But the biggest draw is that unlike Angkor Enterprise, the boat association provides tips to tour guides themselves, attracting more and bigger groups. Vy said that Kampong Phluk was back up to about 80 rides per day, double the numbers in Chong Khneas. A fisher who declined to give his name for fear of reprisal from Angkor Enterprise said that subsistence fishers like him regularly earned extra income taking tourists around on their own motorboats. But Angkor Enterprise has put a stop to that practice, threatening to confiscate fishers’ boats if they’re caught driving tourists around Chong Khneas three times, the fisher said. While he used to be interested in eventually owning his own tourist boat through the official system, the idea no longer appeals. “I can’t be a boat driver there. My family would face difficulties while waiting for 30 to 40 dollars a month,” he said. “That can’t work. We wouldn’t survive.”",

            "content": "The Candlelight Party in Kampong Thom province filed a police complaint against a ruling party member for allegedly destroying a party banner in Stong district. The party filed the complaint on February 6 to Stong district police, alleging that Chhay Cheng, a Cambodian People’s Party member, had dismantled their party billboard in Krasang village on the afternoon of February 5. The complaint asked for the billboard to be returned and legal action to be initiated against Cheng. “Please take immediate action to search for the Candlelight Party banner in order to return it to the party and bring the perpetrator to justice in accordance with the law,” the complaint reads. Stong district police chief Yang Sam said he had received the complaint from the Candlelight Party but that this was a political case and he must wait for directions on how to proceed from his superiors. “I have not yet said how I will handle it because we work with a boss. We have to consult the leader. This is not a criminal case, it is related to politics; we must be careful,” he said. Candlelight Party spokesperson Kimsour Phirith said that when a member of the ruling party makes a mistake legal action is often slow and officials say they have to wait for orders or delay action indefinitely. “First of all, at least call the perpetrator to warn him to stop, as well as to show others who are going to do it that regardless of their party, the law is the law,” he said. National Election Committee spokesperson Hang Puthea said he was unaware of the case and that the stealing of party banners was not within the NEC’s jurisdiction. Election watchdog Nicfec executive director Sam Kuntheamy said it was illegal for CPP members to remove the Candlelight’s banner, so the relevant authorities must take legal action. “Removing the banner is wrong and destroying the property of other people is wrong. The police should deal with it,” he said.",

Human Rights Watch summarizes the reality in one line: “ Cambodia remains a single-party state with fixed and controlled elections, with the ruling Cambodian People’s Party (CPP) controlling all state institutions, including the judiciary .” The same report documents continuing harassment and prosecutions of critics, at home and abroad. That is the frame through which to read the year’s major events in the executive, the legislature, the courts, and the media. Inside the executive, titles have changed but authority has not dispersed. Hun Sen’s shift to the Senate did not remove him from the state’s command chain; it rewired the system to keep him close to the levers. As the Associated Press reminds readers, “ the Senate President serves as active head of state when the king is absent from the country .” That constitutional fact matters in a state where the monarchy often travels and where political signals from the top still carry great weight. In a letter dated August 4, 2025, King Norodom Sihamini has granted Hun Sen permission to oversee the nation’s armed forces and to communicate with his son- Prime Minister Hun Manet- on the military and national defense matters, amid increasing border tension with Thailand. The July 2025 border crisis with Thailand made this visible. Reuters reported that Hun Sen, though no longer prime minister, was at the helm of the response, “ directing military responses, reviewing battlefield maps, and participating in video calls with military officers .” In a moment of real danger, the public saw where final decisions still flow. Prime Minister Hun Manet later fronted diplomacy, but the crisis confirmed that executive power remains concentrated in the same family network. In the legislature, the CPP’s dominance, secured after the main opposition party was excluded from the 2023 ballot, has enabled swift passage of laws that narrow political space. On August 25, 2025, parliament approved a measure to strip citizenship from people convicted of treason or collusion with foreign powers. Reuters ’ straight description is stark enough, “ the law will allow people convicted of treason to be stripped of their citizenship .” Critics warn the language is vague and easily aimed at dissent. The vote count overwhelming in a chamber controlled by one party shows how rule-making follows power rather than public debate. Courts are supposed to check such moves. Instead, international benchmarks register a judiciary that rarely restrains the ruling party. The World Justice Project ’s Rule of Law Index puts Cambodia at 141 st of 142 countries in 2024, last in East Asia and the Pacific. The ranking reflects weak constraints on government power, politicized law enforcement, and poor civil justice, precisely the conditions under which political prosecutions move fast and sensitive corruption cases stall. These are not abstract numbers; they are the everyday explanation for why opposition figures and activists face group trials while well-connected defendants face lighter scrutiny. Civic space and media freedom complete the picture. The CIVICUS Monitor rates Cambodia’s civic space “Repressed,” citing 2025 cases against activists, journalists, and opposition voices. Reporters Without Borders ranks Cambodia 161 st of 180 in its 2025 World Press Freedom Index; the country page records fresh incidents of arrest and judicial pressure on reporters. A press that works under threat cannot do the basic job of informing voters and scrutinizing power, and a fearful civil society cannot provide the independent expertise that good policy needs. Family power is no longer whispered; it is policy. Freedom House’s 2025 report calls the handover from father to son an “ undemocratic transfer of power ,” adding that Hun Sen “ effectively retains most political power in the country .” Earlier, the Associated Press noted the National Assembly’s approval of Hun Manet’s younger brother, Hun Many, as a deputy prime minister, part of a wider pattern in which children and relatives of senior CPP figures step into top roles. Such consolidation does not just boost a family’s profile; it binds the executive, legislative, and administrative chains to the same households, making impartial oversight much harder. The costs of this one-party, family-centered model are visible across public life. When the same circle writes the laws, runs the security apparatus, and faces few judicial checks, rights become permissions and freedoms become privileges. Press rankings slide because reporters weigh legal risks before publishing. Civic space shrinks because activists expect surveillance or summonses. Elections lose credibility because the competition is filtered before ballots are printed. And when crises strike, from border clashes to economic shocks, the state’s response reflects central command, not open institutional debate. Defenders of the system argue that Cambodia needs order, not contestation, and that strong continuity has kept the peace. But stability built on silence is brittle. The July fighting on the Thai border, the nationality-revocation law, and the continuing prosecutions of critics show how easily concentrated power defaults to coercive tools. Even when the government secures short-term compliance, it sacrifices the long-term trust that comes from rules applied equally and institutions that can say “no.” If Cambodia is to widen rights and raise public confidence, the path is no mystery. It begins with allowing genuine competition, restoring opposition parties to the ballot and redrawing election rules to be fair in law and practice. It requires returning parliament to its role as a forum for scrutiny instead of a rubber stamp, including meaningful hearings on laws with rights consequences, such as the new nationality provisions. It depends on a judiciary that is insulated from party control and can adjudicate politically sensitive cases without fear. And it needs a media climate where reporters do not face arrest or ruin for accurate, critical coverage. The benchmarks used by outside observers, World Justice Project, Reporters Without Borders, CIVICUS, Freedom House, are not ends in themselves. They are simple measures of whether institutions restrain power and protect people, or whether power continues to bend institutions to its will. Cambodia’s 2025 record still points in one direction. Power remains tightly held, rights and freedoms are limited, and family networks sit at the top. The quotes are sober and recent: “ single-party state and control of all state institutions ,” from Human Rights Watch; “ Senate President serves as active head of state when the king is absent ,” from the Associated Press; “ ranks 141 st out of 142 ,” from the World Justice Project; “ 161 st out of 180 ,” from Reporters Without Borders; and “ undemocratic transfer of power ,” from Freedom House. None of them describe a system confident enough to spread power or strong enough to be questioned. Until that changes, the title of this essay will continue to describe the country: One-Party Government: Concentrated Power, Restricted Freedoms, and the Exaltation of Family over Law .",

This ubiquitous technology has undergone significant transformations since its inception, with ongoing innovations continuing to push the boundaries of capacity, speed, and reliability. In this article, we will delve into the intricacies of disk storage, exploring its historical development, core principles, and the cutting-edge advancements that are redefining the landscape of data persistence. A Brief History of Disk Storage The first disk storage systems, introduced in the 1950s, relied on magnetic drums and delay lines to store data. These early devices were cumbersome, expensive, and limited in capacity. The advent of the floppy disk in the 1960s marked a significant milestone, offering a more convenient and affordable means of data storage. The introduction of the hard disk drive (HDD) in the 1970s further accelerated the evolution of disk storage, with subsequent generations of HDDs boasting increased capacities, faster access times, and improved reliability. The Mechanics of Disk Storage A typical HDD consists of one or more platters, each coated with a thin layer of magnetic material. Data is written to the platter by a read/write head, which floats above the surface, using a combination of magnetic fields to alter the polarity of the magnetic domains. The resulting pattern of magnetized regions represents the stored data. When data is retrieved, the read/write head detects the changes in magnetic polarity, allowing the system to reconstruct the original information. Advances in Disk Storage Technology In recent years, significant advancements have been made in disk storage technology, driven by the need for higher capacities, faster access times, and improved energy efficiency. Some notable developments include the introduction of solid-state drives (SSDs), which replace traditional mechanical components with flash memory, offering substantially faster performance and lower power consumption. Additionally, the emergence of shingled magnetic recording (SMR) and heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR) technologies has enabled the development of higher-capacity HDDs, pushing the limits of areal density and data storage efficiency. The Future of Disk Storage As the demand for data storage continues to grow, researchers and manufacturers are exploring new technologies to further enhance the capabilities of disk storage. One promising area of research involves the use of novel materials and techniques, such as graphene and nanostructured media, to increase areal density and improve overall performance. Furthermore, the integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms is expected to play a crucial role in optimizing disk storage systems, enabling more efficient data management, predictive maintenance, and enhanced reliability. In conclusion, disk storage has come a long way since its inception, with ongoing innovations transforming the landscape of data persistence. As we continue to push the boundaries of what is possible, it is essential to appreciate the intricate mechanics and scientific principles that underlie this fundamental technology. By understanding the complexities of disk storage, we can better navigate the evolving world of data storage and unlock new possibilities for the future.",

            "content": "Sportswear Design: The Intersection of Science and Style Sportswear design is a fascinating field that combines the principles of physics, biology, and materials science to create high-performance apparel. At its core, sportswear design aims to optimize an athlete's performance while ensuring comfort and safety. In this article, we will delve into the intricacies of sportswear design, exploring the scientific aspects that underpin this innovative field. The Science of Moisture Management One of the critical factors in sportswear design is moisture management. When athletes engage in physical activity, their bodies produce sweat, which can lead to discomfort, chafing, and even heat-related illnesses. To mitigate these effects, sportswear designers employ various techniques to manage moisture. For instance, they use fabrics with high breathability, such as polyester or nylon, which allow for the rapid evaporation of sweat. Additionally, designers incorporate moisture-wicking technologies, like Gore-Tex or similar membranes, that draw sweat away from the skin and release it through the fabric's outer layer. Aerodynamics and Drag Reduction Aerodynamics plays a significant role in sportswear design, particularly in sports like cycling, speed skating, and skiing. By minimizing drag, athletes can achieve faster times and improve their overall performance. Designers use computer simulations and wind tunnel testing to optimize the aerodynamic properties of sportswear. They create streamlined silhouettes, reduce fabric flapping, and incorporate textured surfaces to manipulate airflow. For example, the dimpled texture on golf balls and some sportswear reduces drag by creating a turbulent boundary layer, allowing air to flow more smoothly around the object. Thermoregulation and Climate Control Thermoregulation is another crucial aspect of sportswear design. Athletes often perform in extreme temperatures, ranging from freezing cold to sweltering heat. To maintain optimal body temperature, designers develop clothing that either retains or dissipates heat. For cold weather sports, they use insulating materials like down or synthetic fills, while for warm weather sports, they employ breathable, moisture-wicking fabrics that facilitate heat loss. Some sportswear also incorporates phase-change materials, which absorb and release heat as needed, helping to regulate the athlete's body temperature. Biomechanics and Movement Analysis Biomechanics and movement analysis are essential tools in sportswear design. By studying the movements and motions of athletes, designers can create clothing that enhances performance and reduces injury risk. For example, they may use 3D scanning and motion capture technology to analyze the kinematics of a runner's stride, identifying areas where friction and pressure points occur. This information enables designers to develop targeted support structures, like compression zones or strategically placed cushioning, to improve the athlete's comfort and efficiency. Materials Science and Innovation Advances in materials science have revolutionized sportswear design. New materials and technologies, such as nanotechnology, metamaterials, and smart textiles, offer unprecedented opportunities for innovation. For instance, designers can create self-cleaning fabrics, UV-resistant materials, or garments with integrated sensors that monitor vital signs. The development of sustainable materials, like recycled polyester or plant-based fabrics, also reflects the growing importance of environmental responsibility in the sportswear industry. In conclusion, sportswear design is a multidisciplinary field that seamlessly integrates science, technology, and style. By applying principles from physics, biology, and materials science, designers create high-performance apparel that enhances athlete comfort, safety, and performance. As research and innovation continue to advance, we can expect even more remarkable developments in sportswear design, further blurring the lines between fashion, function, and technology 📯😊.",

Situated at the confluence of three great rivers, the ‘four arms’ of the Mekong, Tonle Sap and Bassac, form right in front of the Royal Palace. Phnom Penh is the commercial, political and cultural hub of the Kingdom and is home to over one million of the country’s estimated 11.4 million people. It is also the gateway to an exotic land….the world heritage site, the largest religious complex in the world, the temples of Angkor in the west, the beaches of the southern coast and the ethnic minorities of the northeastern provinces. The city offers several cultural and historical attractions including the Royal Palace, Silver Pagoda and the National Museum. There are also a wide variety of services including five star hotels and budget guest houses, fine international dining, sidewalk noodle shops, neighborhood pubs, international discos and more. Phnom Penh, like other Asian-city tourist destinations, is in the midst of rapid change. Over the past few years, the number of restaurants and hotels have grown considerably and in the last year there has been a huge increase in the number of visitors. Three overland border crossings have opened since 1998 and now there are daily direct flights from several Asian cities. Even travel within the country is easier with road conditions gradually improving, several airlines flying domestic routes, and regular bus service to major cities like Sihanouk ville and Kampong Cham. Cambodia is becoming easier to visit everyday.",

system, we notice that the media sector has developed in many forms. As a result, many media institutions were established to serve different purposes. Some of them uphold independence in their mission. According to the experience in the past, some Cambodian journalists have received formal journalism training in low level and some others did not implement the professional journalism, which are the causes why the media sector cannot serve the need of the social development and its citizens, especially the need for journalistic ethics. Recognizing ethics as a foundation for practicing journalism, and seeing the lack of code of ethics for journalism, media associations and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) agreed on a common code of ethics in conformity with the ethics of journalism in many developed countries around the world. We, the journalists, believe that having a common code of ethics for journalism is very crucial in improving the confidence among the general public, especially in serving them with sense of seriousness and honesty. 1.

By leveraging computational power and advanced algorithms, scientists can now analyze and interpret vast amounts of biological data, revealing intricate patterns and mechanisms that underlie life itself. One of the key aspects of computational biology is the study of genomic sequences. The human genome, comprising over 3 billion base pairs of DNA, contains the instructions for creating and sustaining life. However, analyzing this vast amount of data poses significant computational challenges. To overcome these challenges, researchers employ advanced mathematical techniques, such as Fourier analysis and wavelet transforms, to identify patterns and features within the genomic sequence. For instance, the use of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) has been instrumental in identifying functional elements within genomic sequences. HMMs are mathematical models that can be used to describe the probability distributions of observable events, allowing researchers to infer the underlying structure of a sequence. By applying HMMs to genomic data, scientists have been able to identify genes, regulatory elements, and other functional regions with high accuracy. In addition to genomic analysis, computational biology has also made significant contributions to the field of protein structure prediction. Proteins, the building blocks of life, play a crucial role in virtually all biological processes. However, determining their three-dimensional structure is a complex task, as it depends on the interactions between thousands of atoms. Computational biologists have developed sophisticated algorithms, such as molecular dynamics simulations and Monte Carlo methods, to predict protein structures and understand their function. The application of computational biology extends far beyond the realm of basic research, with significant implications for medicine and healthcare. For example, computational models of disease progression can be used to simulate the behavior of complex biological systems, allowing researchers to test hypotheses and predict the outcomes of different treatment strategies. Additionally, computational biology has enabled the development of personalized medicine, where genetic information is used to tailor treatment plans to individual patients. Mathematical modeling has played a critical role in the development of computational biology. The use of differential equations, for instance, has allowed researchers to model the behavior of complex biological systems, such as population dynamics and epidemiology. Furthermore, the application of graph theory has enabled the analysis of complex biological networks, revealing insights into the organization and function of biological systems. In conclusion, computational biology has revolutionized our understanding of living systems, enabling researchers to analyze and interpret vast amounts of biological data. Through the application of advanced mathematical techniques and computational power, scientists have gained insights into the intricacies of life, from the structure of proteins to the behavior of complex biological systems. As computational biology continues to evolve, we can expect significant advances in our understanding of life and the development of new treatments for diseases.",

According to H.E. Lt. Gen. Maly Socheata, Under Secretary of State and Spokesperson for the Ministry, the Thai side opened fire again on the morning of Dec. 8, beginning at approximately 05:04 a.m., in the An Ses area of Preah Vihear province. Additional rounds were later fired near Tamone Thom Temple using armored vehicles, as well as in the vicinity of Preah Vihear Temple, the 5 Makara area, and Chamkar Chek. The spokeswoman stated that this latest attack follows a series of provocative actions by the Thai military in recent days, including the incident at Prolean Thmar on the afternoon of Dec. 7, which was carried out with the intention of escalating tensions. The Ministry reaffirmed that, in line with Cambodia’s commitment to all existing agreements and to resolving disputes through peaceful means in accordance with international law, Cambodian forces did not return fire. Cambodian authorities continue to closely monitor and assess the situation with the highest level of caution. Cambodia has formally notified the ASEAN Observers Team (AOT) regarding these incidents and plans to request that AOT visit the site to conduct an investigation to establish the facts and ensure transparency, justice, and accuracy. The Ministry condemned what it described as “inhumane and brutal” actions by the Thai military, saying the attacks clearly violate the Cambodia-Thailand Joint Declaration on Peace Deal, signed on Oct. 26, 2025, by the Prime Ministers of both countries, witnessed by U.S. President Donald Trump and Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who also serves as ASEAN Chair. Cambodia called on the international community to firmly condemn Thailand’s repeated breaches of the Joint Declaration and its unlawful actions, urging that Thailand be held fully accountable. The Ministry further urged Thailand to immediately halt all hostilities, which threaten peace and stability in the region. Cambodia also appealed to Thailand to adhere strictly and sincerely to the ceasefire, the Joint Declaration on Peace Deal, and all obligations under international law. “The Kingdom reiterated its strong commitment to respecting and implementing the ceasefire, the Joint Declaration, and all previous accords reached between the two countries.

Tan Sri Hj Mohd Nizam bin Hj Jaffar, in Phnom Penh on Sunday to discuss regional security, border stability, and the ongoing ASEAN-led mediation effort between Cambodia and Thailand. The meeting occurred during H.E. Gen. Tan Sri Mohd Nizam’s official visit to Cambodia as the head of a Malaysian military delegation. H.E. Gen. Vong Pisen praised Malaysia, the current ASEAN Chair, for its pivotal role in brokering the Cambodia-Thailand ceasefire on July 28, 2025, an agreement also co-chaired by the United States with active participation from China. He specifically acknowledged the Chief of Malaysian Defence Forces' swift action in establishing the ASEAN Ad Hoc Observer Team (AOT) one day after the ceasefire on July 29, 2025, noting its crucial impact in de-escalating tensions and addressing ground-level challenges. However, the Cambodian commander-in-chief alleged that Thai forces have repeatedly violated Cambodia's sovereignty and territorial integrity, including deploying barbed wire and moving troops in contested areas, since the ceasefire and the subsequent 13-point agreement took effect. H.E. Gen. Vong Pisen stressed that Cambodia has, in contrast, strictly upheld all its commitments. In light of these alleged infringements, H.E. Gen. Vong Pisen called on Malaysia, in its capacity as the ASEAN Chair, and the United States, as an agreement witness, to intensify mediation efforts. He urged them to press Thailand to fully re-implement and respect the peace accords, while reaffirming Cambodia’s commitment to resolving disputes through peaceful means, confidence-building, and restoring lasting stability. H.E. Gen. Tan Sri Mohd Nizam, in turn, thanked Cambodia for its cooperation in facilitating the AOT's operations along the border. The Malaysian Defence Forces Chief acknowledged the complexity of ensuring sustainable peace in the area. He pledged that Malaysia would continue its mediating efforts and closely monitor the ceasefire's implementation to help maintain long-term stability. By K. Rithy Reak",

In a press release this morning, the Ministry of National Defence labelled the Thai allegation as false information, stressing that it was the Thai military forces that launched the attack on the Cambodian forces at approximately 05:00 AM in the morning of Dec. 8, 2025. It should be noted that this attack occurred after the Thai forces engaged in numerous provocative actions for many days, especially the incident yesterday at Prolean Thmar area, with the objective of instigating confrontations. “Standing on the spirit of respecting all previous agreements and resolving conflicts peacefully according to international law, Cambodia did not retaliate at all during the two assaults and continues to monitor the situation vigilantly and with utmost caution,” the Ministry emphasised. Additionally, Cambodia, for the second time, has informed the ASEAN Observer Team (AOT) about this incident and plans to request the AOT to conduct an investigation into the matter to ensure transparency, justice, and impartiality.

According to major international media outlets, including CNN, BBC, Al Jazeera, Reuters and The Guardian, Thai forces launched multiple assaults on Cambodian troops and nearby civilian areas. The strikes – reportedly involving heavy weapons, F-16 fighter jets and chemical agents – resulted in numerous Cambodian civilian deaths and injuries. The CHRC said the attacks constitute serious violations of the UN Charter, ASEAN Charter, international human rights and humanitarian law, as well as bilateral ceasefire agreements and the recently signed Cambodia-Thailand Joint Declaration on Peace Deal in Kuala Lumpur, witnessed by U.S. President Donald J. Trump and Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim. The Committee stated that the Thai military’s actions undermine regional peace and contradict ASEAN’s core values of unity and community spirit. The CHRC urged the international and regional community to condemn Thailand’s actions and apply pressure on this country to halt its aggression immediately and take full responsibility under international law for the damages caused. The Committee reaffirmed that, regardless of conflict situations, human rights and international humanitarian law must be upheld, and that the territorial integrity and lives of Cambodian citizens must be protected. It added that Cambodia remains committed to respecting the ceasefire, implementing all peace agreements with Thailand, and pursuing peaceful, lawful solutions to all disputes. Cambodia continues to reject all forms of force or intimidation. The CHRC said it will continue monitoring, documenting and reporting all human rights violations stemming from the Thai military’s actions and stands in solidarity with the Cambodian civilians affected by the attacks.

Post and Telecommunications Minister Chea Vandeth said agile policy frameworks should be adopted while digital inclusion and multilateral cooperation are boosted to tackle cybersecurity threats, online fraud, and harmful content to ensure sustainable and equitable digital development. “Strengthen multilateral cooperation to coordinate efforts in cybersecurity, combat online fraud and illegal content, and build a trustworthy digital environment,” he remarked at the opening of the Cambodia Internet Governance Forum on Saturday. Vandeth also announced that mobile operators are preparing to roll out 5G services in 2026, starting with Phnom Penh and five other provinces. It would be supported by clear investment plans to ensure high-quality telecommunications services. According to him, operators have committed to major infrastructure expansion, including the construction of about 500 antenna towers per operator each year, totaling 2,000 towers over three years. Sok Puthivuth, Secretary of State of the Post and Telecommunications Ministry (MPTC), highlighted two priorities: strengthening online safety as AI becomes more prevalent and ensuring universal, meaningful internet connectivity. He called for use of responsible AI to protect citizens while fostering innovation, as well as affordable, reliable internet access to reduce the digital divide between urban and rural communities. “The internet is no longer just a tool. It’s the backbone of modern society, an essential infrastructure for education and commerce, governance and social connection, as Cambodia moves forward in its digital transformation journey. We stand at a crossroad of immense opportunity,” he said at the three-day forum which ends on Sunday. “We are not here to debate in style, but to listen, learn and develop solutions for cyber security, data governance and digital rights. There must be inclusion through genuine dialog among those present here,” Puthivuth said. Panelists discuss building Cambodia’s inclusive digital society at the Digital Forum on December 6, 2025. (CamboJA/Khuon Narim) Esther McFarlane, office-in-charge of UNESCO Office in Phnom Penh, said that Cambodia is turning recommendations into action, demonstrating national ownership and a commitment to evidence-based digital policy and development. Recently, she noted, the Education, Youth and Sport Ministry, MPTC and national institutions, organized a conference on AI in education, which was inspired by UNESCO’s AI Ethics Readiness Assessment, to call for the development of sector-specific platforms for responsible and human-centered AI. “This is digital governance in action, and it will be vital in shaping a safe, open and inclusive digital future for Cambodia.” UNESCO is supporting MPTC to create Cambodia’s first ICT and AI competency framework for teachers and developing digital solutions ranging from workforce planning to expanding access to flexible learning programs for out-of-school youth. Cyber security expert Prasad Jayabalan from Malaysia’s Axiata Group said digital progress depends on trust, noting that modern digital services—from payments to healthcare and identity—only function well when people feel safe. Cyberattacks increasingly target individuals through misinformation rather than just technical systems, and a “single bad experience” could quickly spread and damage public trust. The solution is to empower citizens to understand their rights, practice basic digital safety, and report issues early, making them a “vital first line of defense”, he said. “The message is very clear, technology and trust must go hand in hand. If we lose trust, we will slow progress. If we build trust, we strengthen our resilience,” he said. He stressed the need for safe practices in an AI-driven environment, and for users to verify information, follow approved tools, and avoid exposing sensitive data, which is a common mistake and one that attackers often exploit. Prasad called for the building of “cyber confidence”, where citizens adopt cautious online habits, while government institutions design secure systems and communicate clearly, and organizations coordinate, share intelligence, and respond together. Sin Putheary, executive director of the Cooperation Committee for Cambodia, pointed out the importance of digital inclusion, particularly for women and marginalized groups who often lack access, skills, and protections when using digital platforms. “Vulnerable groups or women in the rural poor community can be integrated into this big system,” she said, adding that civil society plays a critical role in ensuring that rural and poor communities are integrated into the broader digital system. She said the value of multi-stakeholder engagement is not only for shaping digital policies but also for raising awareness and communicating national strategies to the communities who will ultimately be the end users. Realtor Knight Frank’s Data Centers Report in 2024 quoted Telecommunication Regulator of Cambodia (TRC) as saying that there are 20 million internet subscribers in the country. “Assuming an average of two internet devices per person, we estimate around 10 million internet users in Cambodia. This equates to approximately 60% of the total population using the internet,” it said. 3 views",

            "content": "Listen to the audio version of this article (generated by AI). Almost a month after a deadly flare-up with Thai troops along the Banteay Meanchey border forced hundreds of frontier families to flee, most have now returned, authorities said Thursday. Yet at least 12 families remain in tents just kilometers from their homes behind Thai-installed razor wire they have not been able to cross for nearly four months, a district governor from the disputed areas, Keo Darareaksmey, said. Nearly 850 families from the disputed Chouk Chey and Prey Chan villages, which Thailand claims as its territory, fled in November after one Cambodian civilian was killed and three were injured by gunfire. Phnom Penh says the shots came unprovoked from Thai forces, an account Bangkok denies, saying its troops returned fire after Cambodian soldiers shot into Thai territory. The incident marked the latest in a series of clashes along many disputed areas of the shared border this year, including four days of full-scale border fighting in July that killed dozens and briefly displaced hundreds of thousands on both sides before a ceasefire took hold. Before the November shooting in Banteay Meanchey, a separate blast along the Preah Vihear-Sisaket frontier, where a landmine injured Thai soldiers, prompted Thailand to suspend an expanded ceasefire agreement . “All of the displaced residents have returned to their homes as the situation has calmed, and we have temporarily installed marker posts,” said provincial spokesperson Norng Vuthy. He was referring to the rollout of joint border surveys in the area, which are seen as easing tensions after the collapse of the expanded ceasefire agreement once touted as a step toward peace. Darareaksmey, the governor of O’Chrov district, where Prey Chan and Chouk Chey lie on Cambodian maps, backed Vuthy’s assessment that the area has quieted as residents gradually returned since Nov. 25. He noted, however, that authorities cannot remove the Thai-installed razor wire still barring some families from homes and farms they have lived on and cultivated for decades. He referred questions about the progress of the temporary border demarcation in the disputed zones to the State Secretariat of Border Affairs. Hul Malis, a resident of Prey Chan whose home remains surrounded by barbed wire, said she returned from a displacement camp deeper in Banteay Meanchey about a week ago. “Until now, I’m still living in a tent because Thailand has not yet removed the barbed wire surrounding my house,” she said, urging the Cambodian government to help resolve the issue. Another resident from Chouk Chey, Hol Pharath, said he and his family returned home last week after district authorities allowed villagers back because the situation had calmed. “There were no problems in the camp, but the difficulty was that my wife had just given birth and we have very young children,” he said, noting that his family includes a two-week-old baby. 93 views",

Svay Rieng police have re-arrested five Vietnamese nationals accused of being involved in online scams, including illegal confinement and drug-related offenses, and a woman who allegedly helped them escape, and a Cambodian man on Tuesday, after a bold attempt to flee detention. A civil society group has called for thorough investigation. A video footage , which has gone viral, showed a group of six attempting a dramatic escape while exchanging gunfire with the police as they alighted a truck at the Svay Rieng Provincial Court. One of the detainees walked up to a woman in a mask and black uniform, and was seen taking a gun from her, and immediately started shooting at the police while they tried to flee. No injuries were reported. One man was recaptured after a chase along with a Cambodian detainee, whom prison officials transported to the court, according to General Department of Prisons spokesperson Kheang Sonadin. The rest of the four men and the woman, said to be an accomplice, were caught a few hours later. “The six defendants were charged with drug crime, illegal possession of weapons and confinements,” Sonadin said, adding that they were placed in pretrial detention in January 2025. NGO rights group Licadho operations director Am Sam Ath called on police to thoroughly investigate the case and strengthen the security risks management of prison “This case should be a lesson in the management and security of detainees. There must be a thorough investigation to uncover the truth and ensure legal action is taken,” he said. He recalled a previous incident involving a Taiwanese prisoner convicted of drug trafficking who escaped while receiving dental care in Siem Reap province. Svay Rieng court spokesperson Lay Chungheng briefly said that police are working on the case, declining to comment further. Several police officials, including prison director Kong Sam Ath and Bavet city police officer Em Sovannarith, declined to comment. In addition, Svay Rieng provincial police chief Pech Virak, National Police spokesperson Chhay Kim Khoeun, Interior Ministry spokesperson Touch Sokhak and Men Eng, deputy provincial governor and spokesperson, could not be reached for comment. 8,753 views",

            "content": "Listen to the audio version of this article (generated by AI). While South Korea lowered the alert level on Phnom Penh and Siem Reap, other areas, such as Bokor, Bavet and Poipet cities are still subject to Level 4 alert, which translates to a “travel ban”. South Korea’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced a partial adjustment to its travel advisory for Cambodia effective 4 p.m on Thursday, reflecting a notable “improvement” in the security situation for Korean nationals, particularly for the capital and Siem Reap. The adjustment for Phnom Penh was made to Stage 2 or requiring travel discipline, from Level 2 or a “refrain from travel”, whereas the travel advisory for Siem Reap was improved to Stage 1 or the need to “exercise caution” from Level 2. However, some areas remain under strict advisories, which the Korean ministry considered “high risk”, such as Sihanoukville (Stage 3 or “Recommendation for Evacuation”), Bokor mountain in Kampot province, Bavet City and Poipet City, which are still subject to Level 4, equivalent to “travel bans”. A “special travel advisory” remains in effect for Preah Vihear, Oddar Meanchey, Banteay Meanchey, Battambang, Pailin, Pursat, and Koh Kong provinces. The adjustment follows Cambodia’s intensified crackdown on scams and fraudulent activities targeting foreign nationals, coupled with strengthened bilateral cooperation under the recently launched ‘ Korean Desk’ , a joint task force to combat online scams after a Korean student was murdered in Cambodia. South Korea said the joint task force between Korea and Cambodia has contributed to a “decrease in reported scams in Cambodia, and the tangible improvement in the situation, particularly in Phnom Penh and Siem Reap”. Despite the improvements, the ministry, however, warned that incidents involving Korean nationals continue to surface, especially in areas with Level 3 or high-risk zones. The ministry urged travelers to exercise caution, warning that “those who have accepted job offers promising excessively high salaries or other attractive conditions while visiting Cambodia are at a higher risk of being involved in scams”, and encouraged careful review of travel plans. Responding to the announcement, Interior Ministry spokesperson Touch Sokhak told CamboJA News that it likely reflects Cambodia’s enhanced efforts to crack down on crimes in specific regions, noting that “Cambodia has continuously deployed measures to prevent and investigate crimes”. He also highlighted Cambodia’s close cooperation with South Korea, emphasizing the “effectiveness” of Cambodia’s measures against crime. When asked about South Korea’s designation of areas in Cambodia as high-alert, he said the government’s advisory “reflects concern for their citizens, just as Cambodia considers the welfare of our citizens abroad”. Nathan Paul Southern, operations director at The EyeWitness Project, said South Korea’s decision to lower the travel advisory for Phnom Penh and Siem Reap follows “a highly publicised wave of police raids targeting scam operations”. He remarked that the crackdowns in Cambodia are in response to Korea’s concerns that their “citizens are not safe in Cambodia”, alongside international pressure following sanctions on Prince Group . Southern added that Cambodia aims to signal that “the country is tackling the scam industry and is safe for visitors.” However, he cautioned, while the raids may create the impression that criminal activity is being curtailed, “none of the major operators behind these networks have been detained, and construction of new compounds along the Vietnam and Thailand borders continues unabated,” suggesting the crackdown may be more about diplomatic posturing than a full-scale effort to dismantle the industry. Approximately 200,000 South Koreans visit Cambodia annually, with previous travel warnings issued on September 17 in response to rising safety concerns. At the time, South Korea recommended citizens reconsider trips to Phnom Penh and designated high-risk areas such as Sihanoukville, Bokor Mountain, and Bavet as Level 2.5. In a recent announcement, the Korean ministry emphasized that they would continue to monitor the situation closely and reassess travel advisories as necessary, signaling cautious optimism about Cambodia’s improving security environment. 127 views",

            "content": "The Trump administration’s 90-day suspension of foreign assistance funding has brought critical development programs in Cambodia to a standstill, sparking concern among NGOs and civil society organizations. The Cambodian government has yet to confirm the impact on USAID-supported projects in key sectors. On January 20, President Donald Trump signed an executive order halting U.S. foreign assistance programs for 90 days to review their alignment with his administration’s policy goals. The suspension is part of a broader effort to ensure U.S. foreign aid reflects American values and serves national interests. However, the immediate impact on existing programs is unclear, as many have received funds through Congressional appropriations. The move garnered international criticism, including UN secretary-general Antonio Gutteres, whose spokesperson Stephane Dujarric, quoted him as saying that the aid suspension was concerning as the U.S was the largest aid donor in the world. Globally, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) managed a budget of $22.6 billion for 2025. In Cambodia, USAID contributed over $3 billion to various sectors over the past three decades, ranging from health and agriculture to governance and education. During her visit to Cambodia in October, USAID Administrator Samantha Power announced over $17 million aid to improve healthcare and $29 million for the Food for Progress program to strengthen agriculture and food systems. USAID also offered more than $6 million for civil society, media, and labor initiatives, along with $3 million from the U.S. Department of Labor to support collaboration and opportunities for persons with disabilities. The suspension of U.S. foreign aid has put the future of numerous Cambodian programs at risk. While civil society organizations report immediate disruptions, government agencies have yet to confirm the extent of the impact. NGOs warn that a prolonged pause could hinder Cambodia’s progress in areas like human rights, education, and economic development, while also limiting job opportunities and community growth initiatives. “This suspension of assistance is a major impact on Adhoc’s activities in contributing to the improvement of the human rights and democracy situation in Cambodia,” said Ny Sokha, president of Cambodian rights group Adhoc. “Cambodia is a poor country that needs foreign assistance to develop the country as well as its human resources.” He noted that cutting off significant assistance to poor countries could impact Trump’s popularity, expressing hope that the U.S. would reconsider its stance. He warned that a complete suspension of aid over the next three months will pose serious challenges for civil society organizations, particularly in developing nations. “This will greatly affect our efforts to support vulnerable communities and strengthen democracy in Cambodia,” he added. The suspension has already affected civil society organizations. Chhan Sokunthea, executive director of the Cambodian Center for Independent Media (CCIM), said two USAID-supported projects promoting media and strengthening citizen journalists’ capacity have been impacted. Meng Lihor, a youth leader working on the “Connect Phum 5” project under Future Forum, said her community-building initiative along the Stung Meanchey Canal was suspended on January 25. “We did not think the suspension would affect small projects, but after receiving the news, we felt sad because this project is beneficial to the community,” she said. Similarly, Heng Kimhong, president of advocacy group Cambodian Youth Network (CYN), expressed concerns about the long-term impact of the aid halt. CYN promotes environmental protection alongside youth freedom, human rights and social justice, thus Trump’s withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement would have negative implications on their work. “I would deeply regret a permanent suspension of aid as Cambodia is particularly vulnerable to the loss of international support. We’ve already seen countries like Sweden withdraw aid from Cambodia,” he said. Despite this, he remains hopeful that alternative funding or solutions will be found to ensure sustainability. He emphasized the critical role of aid in fostering democracy, human rights, environmental protection, job creation, economic growth, and human resource development, particularly through skill-building initiatives. “As civil society, I hope the United States and other donors will continue their support to sustain international cooperation. This will ensure the ongoing promotion of democracy, social justice and human rights,” he added. The U.S. Embassy in Phnom Penh declined to comment, citing global directive and directed enquiries to the Department of State. The Department of State and USAID Cambodia did not respond. The concerns voiced by local NGOs were echoed by the U.S.-based think tank Stimson Center, where some of its Mekong-focused projects have been ordered to halt. However, it is actively working to resolve the issue by launching a fundraising campaign to support the continuation of their critical work in the region. Meanwhile, Cambodian government agencies remain uncertain about the aid suspension’s direct impact. Khim Finan, spokesperson of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, said it was unclear how the suspension would affect their projects. Khoun Vicheka, spokesperson of the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport (MoEYS), said no official information has been received. Ly Sovann, Director of the Communicable Disease Control Department under the Ministry of Health, confirmed that USAID funding for health initiatives has not been disrupted. “The process is continuing as usual,” he said. USAID has partnered with MoEYS to enhance Cambodia’s education sector. The $25 million Integrated Primary Education (IPEA) Project focuses on strengthening literacy and numeracy skills for primary school students, supporting the Komar Rien Komar Cheh (children learn, children know) program to improve children’s basic literacy across the country. In 2023, USAID launched the five-year Enhancing Quality of Healthcare Activity II (EQHA II) initiative, with $35 million funding. The EQHA II project will be implemented by FHI 360 with coordination from the Ministry of Health. Government spokesperson Pen Bona did not respond. 3,549 views",

            "content": "CamboJA News has been awarded the World Justice Project’s Anthony Lewis Journalism Prize, recognizing our investigative reporting and daily coverage of issues undermining the rule of law in Cambodia. As one of the country’s last remaining independent newsrooms, CamboJA was recognized for its persistent coverage of civil justice, labor rights, crackdowns on dissent, organized crime, corruption, and regulatory failure – providing critical, impartial journalism for local and international audiences in an increasingly restricted media landscape. This marks CamboJA News’ first major international journalism award. In 2020, its advocacy arm – the Cambodian Journalists Alliance – was nominated for a Reporters Without Borders Press Freedom Award. CamboJA News serves as the editorial division of the Alliance, which was founded in 2019 to defend press freedom and promote ethical, independent journalism in Cambodia. The prize, named for the Pulitzer Prize-winning legal reporter Anthony Lewis, is presented by the World Justice Project (WJP), a global research and civil society organization that promotes the rule of law. The award honors “journalistic courage and craft that strengthens accountability and advances adherence to rule of law principles.” In WJP’s global Rule of Law Index, Cambodia ranks 141st out of 142 countries, a position it has held nearly every year since the index was launched 2015, reflecting deep and persistent rule of law issues. Among the standout work cited was a CamboJA News investigation that uncovered apparent efforts by a senior politician to evade sanctions. The story raised questions about sanctions compliance by foreign firms operating in special economic zones and the extent of state protection for powerful tycoons linked to criminal networks. WJP also highlighted the newsroom’s months-long probe into the national police’s handling of industrial-scale scam operations. That investigation revealed how more than 1,000 potential human trafficking victims went unaccounted for following a police raid on a scam center, underscoring a pattern of negligence. CamboJA News said it was honored by this recognition and proud to have its work spotlighted alongside other outstanding journalists and newsrooms. This year’s runner-up, iStories Media , is an independent Russian outlet operating in exile and providing accountability reporting on abuses linked to Russia’s war in Ukraine. “Thank you to WJP for recognizing the value of our reporting. It means a lot to our team,” said CamboJA News Director Chhorn Chansy. “We’ll keep reporting without wavering.” “I’m ecstatic and incredibly proud of our team,” said CamboJA News Associate Editor Coby Hobbs. “Given the ongoing threats against journalists in Cambodia and the state of press freedom, this is a much-needed moment of positivity for the industry.” CamboJA remains committed to delivering rigorous, independent journalism in Cambodia. That work is made possible by the continued support of our readers and donors, the newsroom said. *For media inquiries regarding CamboJA News’ receipt of the Anthony Lewis Prize, please contact News Director Chhorn Chansy at +855 17 908 849 or editor@cambojanews.com . 718 views",

            "content": "Phnom Penh was the world’s second most polluted city Friday morning, behind only Dhaka, Bangladesh, according to Swiss air quality firm IQAir. Despite a week of high particulate levels choking the capital’s skyline and mounting concerns, officials insists Phnom Penh’s air pollution has yet to reach hazardous thresholds. Early Jan. 24, the city’s air quality hit alarming levels, with an Air Quality Index (AQI) of 191 and fine particle concentrations at 125 micrograms per cubic meter – both classified as “unhealthy.” The Clean Air Cambodia Project also reported high levels of PM2.5, tiny particles that can harm lungs and enter the bloodstream, ranging from 70 to 105 micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m³) the day before. Similarly, the Environment Ministry reported that AQI levels in Phnom Penh and other provinces stayed high from late Thursday to early Friday, with the capital seeing concentrations around 109 µg/m³. On Wednesday, the Ministry of Water Resources and Meteorology announced that the country would experience “foggy conditions” from Jan. 23 to 31. While the ministry warned that the conditions could disrupt transportation, it made no mention of potential health impacts. Air pollution in Phnom Penh and across the country often comes from vehicle emissions, road debris, industrial and agricultural activities, and power generation. In 2022, the World Health Organization reported Cambodia’s annual average PM2.5 levels were five times higher than its recommended limit. The WHO advises daily levels not exceed 15 µg/m³. As concerns over air quality and health risks grow online, the Environment Ministry insists Phnom Penh’s air is acceptable and poses no threat. It emphasized the use of a national formula for measuring air quality, dismissing internet-based indicators and WHO recommendations. “We have our own standards, just as Thailand and other countries have theirs. Thailand’s air quality standard is 30 µg/m³, which also depends on their economic conditions,” said Chea Nara, director of the Environment Ministry’s Air and Noise Pollution Department, adding that Cambodia’s air quality standard is 50 µg/m³. Motorists drive along a street in Phnom Penh on Jan. 24, 2025. (CamboJA/Pring Samrang) Meanwhile, Bangkok – facing pollution levels similar to Phnom Penh’s on Friday – issued advisories urging people to limit outdoor time, wear masks, and closed more than 350 schools , citing health concerns. The Environment Ministry’s spokesperson Khvay Atiya did not respond for comment . Speaking to local media, Atiya confirmed the ministry has deployed mobile units to monitor air quality at 60 sites across Cambodia, including 10 in Phnom Penh. Pedaling the similar talking points as other officials, he asserted that “air pollution levels have not reached a stage that poses serious health risks” and urged citizens “not to panic over social media rumors.” Following reports of worsening air quality, UNICEF Cambodia warned that children are especially vulnerable to pollution due to their developing lungs and weaker immune systems. The Children’s Climate Risk Index shows about 2.7 million children – roughly half of Cambodia’s child population – are exposed to high levels of air pollution. Air pollution remains a major challenge in Cambodia, with serious health and economic impacts. Projections show nearly 5,000 premature deaths annually by 2030 could result from exposure to air pollution, driven by economic growth, population expansion, and an aging population. Dr. Eng Or Chanmoly, an air quality researcher at the Institute of Technology of Cambodia, attributed the pollution spike to weather changes, including temperature and humidity, and the shift to the dry season, which allows pollutants from local and transboundary sources to stagnate. He noted that rising pollution levels reflect an increase in sources, such as the growing number of vehicles on Phnom Penh’s streets.

            "content": "After the Trump administration this year axed most U.S. foreign aid and public broadcasters serving parts of the world with scant press freedom, the fallout laid bare the shaky crutch propping up independent media in underserved regions. In 2024, before the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) was dismantled and absorbed by the State Department under the second Trump administration’s “waste, fraud and abuse” cuts, Congress approved nearly $272 million for “Independent Media and Free Flow of Information.” Most of these funds went directly to journalism and media development in regions across the world lacking independent news outlets. After the rollback scrapped the initiative and dozens of similar country-specific programs, many independent newsrooms from Afghanistan to Myanmar and Cambodia lost all or most of their operating budgets, casting doubt on the sector’s survival. In more than 50 countries, newsrooms have shut down, reporters have lost jobs and disinformation threats have grown, according to an assessment of the cuts by a consortium of media development groups. The successive blow came weeks after USAID was forced to cut 80% of its programs in March, when the Trump administration issued an executive order dismantling public broadcasters Voice of America (VOA) and Radio Free Asia (RFA), two crucial sources of balanced news for millions in Southeast Asia. In Cambodia, which has struggled for decades to keep media outside state influence alive, coverage of democratic backsliding, indigenous rights, the online scam industry, environmental crime, critical journalism itself and other sensitive topics has thinned. The few remaining independent journalists and newsrooms are seeking alternative donors or commercializing to replace U.S. aid, which has been hard to match. Veteran reporters who once covered these beats now take on alternative livelihoods to sustain themselves. Vulnerable communities say they feel unheard. As Independent Media Fades, ‘It’s Like Closing Our Eyes and Ears’ Lan La, a Kuy indigenous resident of Mondulkiri province, was a regular listener to RFA’s Khmer-language radio broadcasts before they went dark. “Independent media is very important and necessary for spreading information to local communities,” he said. “When they are closed, we are helpless and do not know how to get our problems heard.” RFA was forced to suspend operations in Cambodia in 2017 amid rising crackdowns on free press. Many of its reporters went into exile – some even jailed – but it continued to broadcast and publish reports on Cambodia until it was effectively shuttered this year. Fewer than a handful of independent newsrooms still consistently report on issues affecting marginalized groups, including CamboJA News, which relied on U.S. funding. A logo of Radio Free Asia is displayed in its office, following the termination of funding for RFA, which broadcasts in nine Asian languages, a day after U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order gutting the government-funded media outlet’s parent and six other federal agencies, in Washington, D.C., U.S. March 15, 2025. REUTERS/Staff The $7 million USAID-funded Cambodian Media Development Activity , a flagship initiative relied on by a handful of nonprofit newsrooms and media development groups to cover underreported issues, was one of the projects axed earlier this year. Longtime Prime Minister Hun Sen, who handed power to his son in 2023, lauded Trump after he cut funding to RFA, calling it a “major contribution to eliminating fake news, disinformation, lies, distortions, incitement and chaos around the world.” But La said such outlets have been vital in raising awareness of problems in rural and indigenous communities, particularly land rights and forest crimes – two entrenched issues facing the country. Several other indigenous and rural community members CamboJA News spoke with said the same. The absence of independent media and the reliance on RFA and VOA radio, a main source of news for many Cambodians, has hurt reliable, critical journalism and left a gap in coverage of issues that matter most to them. “When independent media is lost, we end up with incomplete information and lose trusted sources,” La said, hoping the U.S. president would restore funding for media development and broadcasters in Asia. For activists like Sea Davy, a land rights defender from Boeung Tamok, the decline of independent media has direct consequences for social justice. “Without these outlets, our advocacy is lost. It’s like closing our eyes and ears,” Davy said. She warned that as press space shrinks, social injustices are likely to multiply unchecked.

(CambJA/Pring Samrang) While the government claims press freedom is alive and well, citing figures that clash with Cambodia’s low ranking on the global press freedom index , the limited international and independent media in the country again became a public talking point during recent border clashes with Thailand. Many Cambodians criticized what they saw as biased or limited coverage of the conflict – a shortfall observers attribute to the country’s depleted press corps. From the Newsroom to Working Sales Meas Da once reported on labor and land disputes for VOA Khmer. Now she works in a Phnom Penh cosmetics store. “I never thought the place we worked with such passion would close so suddenly,” she said while on a weekend break. “It felt like losing a part of myself. Journalism wasn’t just a job – it was a way to give a voice to those who are never heard.” Despite her reporting background and journalism degree, Da turned to selling cosmetics after VOA furloughed the Khmer team, saying most newsrooms in Phnom Penh and beyond shy away from the critical topics she cares about, while a funding crunch at the remaining independent outlets has left scant job opportunities.

(Photo supplied) Da’s former VOA colleague, Lors Liblib, faced the same dilemma in Cambodia’s shrinking professional journalism market. After three years of reporting for the shuttered outlet, he became a real estate agent in the capital. He still hopes to return to VOA one day and that nonprofit newsrooms will secure the funding to keep covering human rights and politics without influence. VOA’s fate now rests with several U.S. federal judges weighing lawsuits that challenge the authority of Trump appointee Kari Lake, head of the U.S. Agency for Global Media – the federal parent of VOA, RFA and other international broadcasters – to close the congressionally funded outlet.

(CamboJA/Sovann Sreypich) For freelance journalists in Cambodia and the region, long-form reporting on topics such as environmental issues has depended largely on U.S. support and global media development organizations. Meng Kroy Punlok, a young Phnom Penh-based journalist, said he once published 10 stories a month on land rights, environmental degradation and political issues with the help of grants and freelance budgets from nonprofit newsrooms. “The loss has emptied my pockets and weighed heavily on my mind,” he said. “I thought about giving up journalism entirely, but I can’t abandon the work.” Organizations such as the Earth Journalism Network, whose anchor funder was once USAID, provide story grants, training, resources, and mentorship for journalists such as Punlok in low- and middle-income countries focusing on environmental reporting. The group has shifted more toward alternative donors after the rollback of U.S. aid, including Sweden’s international development agency, to keep funding reporting in the Asia-Pacific region. While it secured grants in March for environmental coverage in underserved newsrooms in the region, none went to Cambodian outlets.

Lost Outlets, Lean Operations: Free Press on the Edge Over the past 30 years, the U.S. has given Cambodia $3 billion in aid for health care, education, food security, economic growth, democracy, human rights, environmental programs and clearing unexploded ordnance. U.S. funding for public-interest newsrooms in Cambodia first became prominent in 2003, when local outlet Voice of Democracy launched with USAID support . The outlet, which helped break the story on the burgeoning scam industry in Cambodia, was shut in February 2023 after then-Prime Minister Hun Sen revoked its license over a report he said misrepresented his son Hun Manet’s role in approving foreign aid. Months later, Hun Sen handed power to Hun Manet. The closure was seen as removing one of the last pillars of independent media, after The Cambodia Daily closed in 2017 over a disputed $6.3 million tax bill and the Phnom Penh Post was sold in 2018 to a businessman with government ties, prompting mass resignations. For nonprofit media still covering sensitive topics such as threats to the rule of law while often fearing reprisal in the process, past reliance on USAID has destabilized operations, forcing cuts and uncertainty as outlets scramble for alternative donors or even try to commercialize. It also has prompted them to reevaluate their sustainability models. Cambodian Journalists Alliance Association (CamboJA) executive director Nop Vy said the NGO, which provides media training, advocacy research into press freedoms, and hosts the CamboJA News publication arm, relied on USAID grants for more than half its operational expenses, similar to many other civil society groups in the country. “CamboJA has tried to engage many alternative partners, but only a few have provided support, as they have limited budgets and capacity themselves,” he said, noting that some European nations have also rolled back foreign aid this year. “To avoid reducing or cutting staff, we’ve trimmed costs elsewhere – moving to a cheaper office and scrutinizing every expense, down to coffee and meeting refreshments.” Vy said the return of some U.S. donor funds after federal court challenges, along with efforts to diversify the group’s donor pool, has eased pressure. Still, long-term planning remains a daily concern. CamboJA Executive Director Nop Vy speaks at a journalism training session organized by the association. December 9, 2024. (CamboJA/Hok Lika) Financial sustainability is one of the main concerns for journalists in Cambodia, both at media organizations and individually. A survey of 100 journalists by the Cambodian Center for Independent Media found that more than 70% cited it as a concern. Ninety-one percent reported feeling unsafe due to their work. For Kiripost, a local independent newsroom that received some USAID funding and reports mainly on business and tech news, quick – but challenging – pivots to commercialization may be the path forward. “For news organizations still able to adapt, immediate action is crucial – prioritize monetization and secure the future of your newsrooms,” CEO Prak Chan Thul said. When asked about the fallout of U.S. assistance for the media in Cambodia, Ministry of Information spokesperson Tep Asnarith said the government welcomes international cooperation to expand citizens’ access to information, but only on the condition that it “respects Cambodia’s sovereignty and independence.” “The Ministry of Information calls on all donor countries to adhere to truth, neutrality and high responsibility in their projects, without linking assistance – whether technical support or funding – to agendas that may affect Cambodia’s sovereignty and independence, or exploiting the media to serve their own politics,” he said. Journalists interview a source in Phnom Penh on April 23, 2025. (CamboJA/Pring Samrang) The government has long accused journalists at U.S.-funded outlets and activists with Western-backed groups of serving foreign interests or siding with opposition parties, many since dissolved or banned. In 2017, two former RFA reporters were jailed for more than a year on espionage charges after continuing to work following the broadcaster’s Phnom Penh bureau closure. As Cambodia’s independent newsrooms cling to life, the challenges of lost U.S. funding and political pressure are echoed across the globe. Media development groups report similar blows to exiled outlets from Myanmar and other fragile democracies. Continued shocks could hollow out free press globally, leaving communities without reliable information and amplifying state narratives. For journalists still reporting, survival depends on innovation, international support and the hope that audiences – and donors – keep backing reporting that holds power to account. 806 views",

            "content": "Listen to the audio version of this article (generated by AI). Concerns have mounted over lesser-known rules in Cambodia’s National Social Security Fund (NSSF), as self-employed workers and civil society groups say informal workers are at risk of losing healthcare benefits after going more than six months without paying into the scheme, a lapse the fund deems “voluntary abandonment.” Under the NSSF, social security coverage such as healthcare, unemployment and pensions is provided to workers in the formal, private and public sector. As of 2023, more than two million private-sector employees and about 400,000 public-sector workers were registered, though benefits remain limited and dependent on aid-reliant services such as the health sector. The national fund is also limited, as more than 88% of Cambodian workers are informally employed. A self-employed digital creator in Phnom Penh who asked not to be identified for privacy reasons, wrote on Facebook Wednesday that she permanently lost access to her healthcare benefits after missing six months of payments into the NSSF’s voluntary contribution scheme for self-employed workers. She said the policy seemed unreasonable, noting the NSSF told her she had “abandoned” her payments, which disqualified her from the voluntary scheme rather than allowing her to pay a fine or make back payments. She later deleted her widely shared post after speaking with NSSF officials and posted a follow-up summarizing their response. Officials confirmed she cannot rejoin the scheme as a self-employed member under current rules, though she could regain benefits if she enters formal employment. They also said future policy changes may create a pathway for self-employed workers to re-enroll. Other workers have voiced similar concerns. Sovan Vary, a tuk-tuk driver in Phnom Penh, said she worries missing payments could result in a lifetime ban. Her monthly contribution is about 15,600 riel, roughly $4, nearly a day’s wage for many informal ride-hailing workers in the capital. Vary said the NSSF program for informal workers helps ease healthcare expenses. “I think setting such conditions is very harmful. People are poor, and lack of knowledge or simple negligence may occur because everyone is busy with their business,” she said. For the most vulnerable, Cambodia’s IDPoor program provides subsidized or free healthcare, though accessibility lags for households that quickly qualify after economic shocks. Khong Leakhena, who formally works at a bank in Phnom Penh, called for a penalty system that allows back payments instead of imposing a lifetime ban, stressing that public services should be simple and accessible to all workers. “It would be good if the penalty were as low as possible for the number of months someone has to pay back before they can use the NSSF again,” she said. Civil society groups have made similar calls. Vorn Pao, president of IDEA Cambodia, a global advocacy group supporting informal traders, said citizens who miss payments should face fines or be referred to social assistance rather than losing benefits for life. He also urged fairer tax collection and noted that the NSSF has made progress by allowing workers from all sectors, including the self-employed, to join the system. Addressing concerns with local media Wednesday, Heng Sophannarith, deputy director general of the NSSF, said under the voluntary health care contribution scheme, missing payments for more than six months is considered a voluntary waiver. He stressed members can regain benefits if they later take formal employment and that the rule only applies to the voluntary scheme. 115 views",

            "content": "Police have raided suspected online scam centers in at least six provinces since Wednesday, following a government directive and a high-level meeting with Prime Minister Hun Manet – but major known compounds and politically connected elites remain untouched, according to a transnational crime expert and a watchdog group. Reports have also emerged of local authorities undermining the crackdown by allegedly releasing suspects, while images from Kampong Speu appear to show suspected scammers – whether coerced or complicit remains unclear – leaving a compound ahead of a raid. More than 1,000 foreigners have been detained so far, including more than 115 women. Most are Chinese, Vietnamese, Thai, Indonesian, Bangladeshi, Taiwanese, and Myanmar nationals, according to police reports. The bulk of the raids took place Wednesday into the night across the provinces Kampong Speu, Pursat, Kratie, Banteay Meanchey, Preah Sihanouk and Phnom Penh. “The fact that none of these raids have targeted the major, well-known scam compounds is exactly the point – this is a tightly orchestrated exercise designed to produce the appearance of decisive action while preserving the core industry and the interests of the involved elites,” said Jacob Sims, a visiting fellow at Harvard University’s Asia Center who studies transnational crime networks and has researched state involvement in Cambodia’s scam operations. Industrial-scale scam centers have long proliferated across Cambodia in recent years, with estimates predating Wednesday’s raids suggesting as many as 350 active sites generating between $12 billion and $19 billion annually. The compounds rely largely on forced or coerced labor, with some 150,000 people from at least 22 countries exploited, according to Winrock International, which led the Cambodia Counter Trafficking in Persons project. “These compounds are not obscure or hidden. Many have been documented by Amnesty International, Cyberscam Monitor, my own investigations, and others – some even previously visited by authorities without serious consequence,” Sims said. “Yet the sites owned or operated by the most powerful CPP-linked [Cambodian People’s Party] elites remain unscathed.” Preah Sihanouk provincial authorities raid a building suspected of operating an online scam on July 15, 2025. (Photo from National Police) A report published by Sims in May recommended indictments, sanctions, visa bans and other accountability measures for 28 government officials and businesspeople – including Prime Minister Hun Manet’s cousin, Hun To – over alleged links to or complicity in the illicit industry, triggering a wave of condemnation from officials. Cyberscam Monitor, a regional watchdog tracking online crime networks, has identified at least 181 suspected scam sites nationwide, including six compounds near a suspected ring raided in Phnom Penh’s Toul Kork district on July 14. It also noted that major well-known compounds have yet to be targeted. One suspected major scam site yet to face a crackdown is a compound in Takeo province known as “Mango Park 2” on scam watchdog channels. It is roughly nine kilometers from Mango Park in Kampong Speu, which was reportedly raided by national police late last year but appeared to still be operating then, with more than 1,000 potential trafficking victims unaccounted for at the time. Reports of syndicates colluding with local authorities during the raids have also surfaced. During an operation in Pursat province on Wednesday evening, a deputy prosecutor allegedly “released a group of online scammers,” according to government-friendly media Fresh News, which cited a leaked audio message of Hun Manet ordering action against the official. Circulating social media posts verified by CamboJA News appear to show individuals fleeing a compound in Kampong Speu’s Kong Pisey district with their luggage just before a raid. Police later said they detained 63 people, mostly Chinese, in the operation. Asked if those detained in the raids were screened for trafficking, a step anti-trafficking experts have formally criticized authorities for neglecting, Chou Bun Eng, Permanent Vice Chair of the National Committee to Counter Trafficking, said procedures are in place to determine whether individuals are victims, scammers, or living in Cambodia illegally. “In the recent crackdowns, our initial screenings primarily uncovered immigration and labor law violations,” she said. “When it comes to other offenses, I firmly believe this group will not give us clear or accurate answers.” She added that spending too much time investigating every offense would strain detention facilities and draw more criticism for human rights violations. She called for “shared responsibility” with countries of origin, urging them to take back their nationals for further questioning while Cambodia focuses on prosecuting offenders in court. Asked about the number of scam sites operating in the country, a figure raised by Cyberscam Monitor and other investigators, Chou replied, “We are conducting investigations. How many we will actually find, we’ll see.” Provincial police chiefs in Banteay Meanchey and Pursat, Sar Theng and Seth Lous, did not respond to requests about whether major scam compounds have been targeted, if trafficking screenings took place, or if ringleaders or compound owners have been arrested or are under investigation. National police spokesperson Chhay Kim Khoeun also declined to comment. For Sims, a genuine crackdown would require holding accountable senators, governors, cabinet ministers, and senior advisers close to the Prime Minister – figures he identifies as owning and protecting the major scam compounds. But he says the political realities make this unlikely, and meaningful disruption will have to come from outside Cambodia. Drawing on his research, Sims views this week’s directive and raids as largely performative, aimed at easing international pressure while consolidating power among elites. He notes this pattern has played out before in sectors like illegal logging, where crackdowns targeted small operators but shielded well-connected interests. 1,722 views",

            "content": "Listen to the audio version of this article (generated by AI). Cambodia’s ties with the U.S. have grown closer under the Trump administration, unlike during Joe Biden’s term when Washington pressured Phnom Penh to promote democracy and human rights. But analysts opined that the closeness may be less about genuine partnership, and that Trump’s foreign policy on pragmatism in foreign policy may not last. Recently, the U.S. officials repeatedly signaled a desire to re-engage Cambodia as a potential partner in the Indo-Pacific. A State Department spokesperson told international media that the U.S. aims to improve Cambodia’s investment climate and international standing, including dismantling online scam operations targeting Americans, ending politically-motivated prosecutions, and allowing independent media to operate freely. The shift comes after a turbulent period in bilateral trade. In April, the Trump administration imposed a 49% tariff on Cambodian goods—the second-highest levy—accusing Cambodia of serving as a major transshipment hub for Chinese products to evade U.S. tariffs. The U.S. has long been Cambodia’s largest export market, particularly for garments, footwear, and electrical machinery. However, the tone changed dramatically in the following months. In August, President Donald Trump announced a reduced 19% tariff on Cambodian imports, followed by a bilateral trade deal in October on the sidelines of the ASEAN Summit in Malaysia. As part of the agreement, Cambodia committed to applying zero tariffs on U.S. goods. The U.S. president also intervened to end the five-day clash between Cambodia and Thailand in July leading to the Peace Agreement. Prime Minister Hun Manet and senior officials publicly praised him for his role in resolving the deadly border conflict, culminating in the nomination of Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize. On November 6, U.S Secretary of State Marco Rubio lifted the long-standing arms embargo on Cambodia, citing the country’s “diligent pursuit of peace and security”, renewed cooperation on defense and countering transnational crime. Both sides also agreed to resume the joint military exercise, Angkor Sentinel, after it was halted in 2017. The new efforts are in stark contrast to the Biden administration. Relations were fraught at the time, with Washington repeatedly raising concerns about human rights abuses, the crackdown on the media, and Cambodia’s military ties with China. Days after the July election, when Hun Sen handed power to his son Hun Manet, the Biden administration said the polls were not free and fair, while announcing new visa and funding restrictions. During Biden’s term, tycoon Ly Yong Phat was also sanctioned for his alleged role in human trafficking and online scam networks. Washington also expressed alarm over China’s expansion of Ream Naval Base, fearing that it would host a Chinese military facility. Independent political analyst Ly Sreysrors said Cambodia’s strategic geography has long been seen as “valuable” to the U.S and China. She said Trump’s intervention in the recent border dispute shows renewed attention on Cambodia, but largely because the president places less emphasis on democracy than previous U.S. administrations. “When the U.S. does not focus on democratic values, Cambodia and the new administration seem to get along easily,” she said. “This dynamic has allowed both sides to forge a closer friendship.” However, she emphasized that U.S. engagement remains driven by American interests, not by Cambodia’s importance as a strategic partner. Sreysrors said that while the relations appear cordial, they are unlikely to weaken Cambodia’s long-standing ties with China. That said, regional dynamics are also shifting, she noted, pointing to Thailand, which is traditionally close to the U.S., but whose King recently visited China. Political commentator Ro Vannak told CamboJA News that Cambodia’s foreign policy with the US is “up and down”, referring to Biden and Trump’s policies. But, the policies are in the context of decreasing China’s influence in the region and especially in Cambodia, so the U.S. might treat Cambodia as a country of geopolitical importance but “not a strategic partner or true ally”. “Trump is using pragmatism in foreign policy with Cambodia, but it is not sustainable in the long run because he is only thinking about U.S. interests [containment of Chinese influence]. So when Cambodia benefits the U.S., Trump will cooperate,” Vannak said. However, he remarked, the difference between the foreign policies was that Biden’s administration focused on expanding and strengthening the U.S. presence and power through the implementation of “liberal hegemony foreign policy”, meaning it tried to promote liberal institutions that refer to multilateral free trade and appreciation of human rights and democracy. On the other hand, he said, Trump “does not value” democracy and human rights, rather economic interests in the region and the benefits and prestige of Cambodia to the U.S., especially to Trump himself. Hence, why the Cambodian government is “trying to please” Trump to the point of nominating him for the Nobel Peace Prize. “If we really look at it, Trump is the one who caused the problems of world order, but in the end he seems to be praised for trying to find world peace,” he added. In line with Trump’s current policies, Vannak viewed that the U.S. would cooperate with Cambodia to reap the benefits, while human rights and democracy might be an agenda in the next presidential term. But to ensure good cooperation with the U.S., Cambodia should fully embrace democracy and uphold rule of law and political integrity, and fight corruption and scams, he advised. Government spokesperson Pen Bona declined to comment, referring CamboJA News to Article 53 of the Constitution, which states that Cambodia pursues a policy of “permanent neutrality and non-alignment”. 391 views",

            "content": "Listen to the audio version of this article (generated by AI). After media and rights groups sounded the alarm over new regulations they say tighten the government’s hold on what remains of Cambodia’s independent press, Information Minister Neth Pheaktra said the rules apply only to “newcomers,” not “recognized” outlets, a line critics say is blurry and ripe for censorship. In late November, the Ministry of Informations issued a Prakas, or regulation, that took effect immediately and created a new licensing system for anyone producing journalism or even general content, covering newsrooms, journalists associations, advertising firms and public figures. The rules set qualification requirements for key editorial roles, including a bachelor’s degree or ministry-approved journalism certificate, “good conduct” reports from authorities and a clean “complaint” record. Many of the requirements also extend to applications for next year’s press cards. Facing criticism that the rules could legally disqualify journalists and newsrooms, Pheaktra told local media this week that the new requirements apply only to newly established media outlets and digital content creators. “The conditions in the regulation do not apply to those who are already operating, because we already recognize them,” he said, appearing to refer to outlets with valid ministry licenses and active reporting operations. “There should be no concerns for those who are currently working. Our focus is on new entrants – people coming into the profession now and in the future.” He noted, however, that existing publications and broadcasters must still submit an application to the ministry, after which “they can continue their work in accordance with their qualification.” Pheaktra, who has faced backlash from civil society groups over expanded rules they say target independent media, did not clarify how independent and freelance journalists qualify as previously recognized, or what counts as a new entrant. It is also unclear whether similar press card regulations will still apply to those who have held one before. Cambodian Center for Independent Media executive director Chhan Sokhunthea said the minister’s explanation remains unclear. “My concern is for journalists reporting on sensitive topics such as land issues, natural resources, online crimes, or trafficking, who may face challenges in applying for licenses or press cards because of the many conditions,” she said. She noted particularly concerning requirements, including securing a letter of good conduct from local authorities and confirming they are not facing lawsuits or complaints. Cambodian Journalists Alliance Association (CamboJA) executive director Nop Vy echoed Sokhunthea, saying additional applications for established outlets will be burdensome and create uncertainty. “It creates barriers for journalists to exercise their rights and freedom and could lead to censorship,” he said. Ministry spokesperson Tep Asnarith gave no clarity on whether recognized outlets will later be required to meet the new rules, repeating Pheaktra’s line that “carrying out an application is to fulfil with qualification conditions.” The vagueness sparks uncertainty as Cambodia faces rising international criticism over shrinking civic space and the erosion of free press. The country ranks 161 out of 180 on Reporters Without Borders’ World Press Freedom Index. Speaking at a Thursday event in Phnom Penh marking the International Day to End Impunity for Crimes Against Journalists, Centre for Law and Democracy executive director Toby Mendel said the new prakas violates international law by restricting who may practice journalism. He added that the regulation’s stated aim of professionalizing the sector “will absolutely not improve journalism” in Cambodia, and called for genuine engagement between the government and the media. But the Information Ministry has already moved forward with the rules, brushing off concerns they violate international law. Phos Sovann, director general of the ministry’s General Department of Information and Broadcasting, said Cambodians “still have a limited understanding of the media,” arguing that some level of control was needed alongside the 2024 press charter and existing laws. “Our people believe whatever they see, so some measures to manage will be considered, as we see in other countries who have already practiced [regulating journalists],” he added. 33 views",

He is set to be extradited to Cambodia to face legal proceedings following a request from the Cambodian authorities to list him on Interpol’s Red Notice. Sithy, who posted his allegations against government leaders regularly on his Facebook account , went silent two days ago as news of his arrest surfaced. Interior Ministry spokesperson Touch Sokhak confirmed that Sithy was arrested a few days ago and that Cambodia is completing procedures with the country where Sithy was arrested. According to Fresh News, Sithy was arrested at the Russian border. However, the spokesperson said the arrest was not related to Sithy defaming government leaders but because he evaded arrest warrants and other complaints in November. “The arrest was not because he defamed high-ranking government officials but it is because he evaded [an] arrest [order] which was issued by the court earlier,” Sokhak said. Prior to the arrest, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation sent a letter to Cambodian embassies overseas to inform them that the Ministry of Interior has annulled Sithy’s passport on the back of an arrest warrant for charges of blackmail. In November , Phua Gek Seng, a Singaporean citizen who holds Cambodian citizenship, filed a lawsuit against Sithy, accusing him of defamation and extortion. The lawsuit followed Sithy’s allegations that Phua operated the largest online casino network in Cambodia, engaged in money laundering activities, and paid $5 million to National Police Commissioner Sar Thet to fabricate a false report to facilitate his arrest. Sithy, a real estate businessman whose honorary tycoon title was revoked by the King in late December 2024, also accused several high-ranking officials of corruption and involvement in cybercrimes. He alleged that Kandal Provincial Governor Kuoch Chamroeun amassed hundreds of millions of dollars in cryptocurrency during his tenure as Governor of Preah Sihanouk (2019–2024). Sithy further implicated Interior Minister Sar Sokha and Phnom Penh Municipal Police Chief Chuon Narin of corruption. Additionally, he accused Hun To, a nephew of former Prime Minister Hun Sen, of embezzling $9 million from a Chinese investor seeking approval for a mining project. Kuoch Chamroeun , Sar Thet , Sar Sokha , and Hun To have all denied the allegations. Sithy also denounced Cambodia as a country full of online scams or call center crimes, which he believed seriously affected Cambodia’s image on the international stage, particularly in terms of economy, trade, investment, and tourists. 3,370 views",

            "content": "Hope turned to shock and despair as a leaked document detailed the US government’s permanent cancellation of funding for 30 USAID programs in Cambodia, dashing expectations that the Trump administration might reconsider its January foreign aid freeze. President Donald Trump, reaffirming his “America First” policy, imposed a 90-day suspension on all foreign aid upon resuming office on January 20. Just 45 days into the review, a whistleblower disclosed to US senators a list of thousands of USAID programs that have been cut. On Monday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced the completion of the administration’s six-week overhaul of the six-decade-old USAID, slashing 83% of its programs. The review led to the termination of around 5,200 contracts, with officials citing misalignment with US national interests. Rubio also confirmed that the remaining aid programs would be overseen by the State Department. In the leaked 368-page document detailing terminated USAID awards, 30 contracts in Cambodia, listed on pages 147-149, were eliminated, totaling a combined value of $260 million. These contracts funded crucial programs in health, education, child protection, independent media, civil society, human rights, and combating human trafficking. Civil society organizations relying on USAID funding have been notified of contract terminations, leaving them with few options—seeking support from other donors or the government, scaling back operations or relying on volunteers; the worst case scenario being total collapse. Meanwhile, the Cambodian government has downplayed concerns about the aid cuts. Of the 30 canceled contracts, only nine had been fully paid, while 21 are ongoing but are now listed for termination. The cuts include $25 million allocated for the Integrated Primary Education (IPEA) Project, aimed at strengthening literacy and numeracy skills among primary school students. Another $7 million for a USAID-funded program supporting UNICEF’s collaboration with Cambodia’s Ministry of Education to improve teacher training and education management and $20 million for USAID Integrated Early Childhood Development (IEDC) Activity. In the health sector, $15 million in funding for tuberculosis (TB) diagnosis, treatment, and prevention was eliminated, even as the TB epidemic in Cambodia worsened in 2024 . This year, 33,363 TB cases were reported, a slight increase from 32,286 cases in 2023. Cambodia has committed to ending TB by 2030. Additionally, $19 million allocated for the Cambodia Malaria Elimination Project (CMEP 2) was also terminated. Also canceled were the $24 million Feed the Future Cambodia Agriculture Partnership Hub, which promotes sustainable economic growth, and programs to combat human trafficking where $13 million was allocated. Beyond development-focused initiatives, civil society and democracy promotion efforts are affected. A $7 million Cambodian Media Development Activity , which supported independent journalism has been cut, along with a $20 million project designed to empower Cambodian civil society and expand civic space, human rights activity, protecting fundamental freedoms, democracy, land rights, and natural resources, was stopped. The Advancing Labor and Workers’ Rights in Cambodia program, worth $10 million, has also been canceled, as well as a $12 million Civil Society Resilience activity. Hong Reaksmey, Country Director of Save the Children Cambodia, called the US aid cuts a disaster, pointing out their severe impact on thousands, especially children. “This decision is wrong. It harms lives, education, and vulnerable people,” he said. A US federal judge ordered the Trump administration to release nearly $2 billion in unlawfully withheld USAID funds, ruling it likely exceeded its constitutional authority. Save the Children Cambodia lost two contracts supporting children and people with disabilities, forcing staff layoffs. Reaksmey said finding emergency donors is difficult, and recovery will take time. He urged the US to reconsider and called on other donors to step in, warning that civil society groups are vital in filling gaps left by the government. He said the only options are finding new donors and negotiating for government funds, though support may be slow. He also expressed concern that if the situation persists without assistance, the civil society organization could collapse. Chhan Sokunthea, Executive Director of the Cambodian Center for Independent Media (CCIM), voiced concerns over the abrupt funding cutoff, explaining that her organization received an official notice from the US State Department about the unilateral termination of its USAID-funded project. She highlighted the significant impact of this funding loss, particularly on organizations relying on direct USAID support, with human rights abuse victims being the most affected. “In the future, civil society organizations will operate on a smaller scale, and social workers may have to continue their work voluntarily,” Sokunthea added. She called on funders from other democratic nations to step in and support efforts to promote human rights and democracy, particularly urging organizations like the European Union to find alternative funding sources to fill the gap left by USAID’s withdrawal. Similarly, Seng Sovathana, Executive Director of the Cambodian Center for Human Rights (CCHR), expressed hope of recovering the lost funds but acknowledged significant concerns about the cuts’ effects. “Many communities depend on those involved in human rights and legal aid,” he said. “Without funding for social work, we face challenges in supporting these communities, especially those who rely on us to promote and protect their rights.” Sovathana revealed that CCHR is in discussions with national and international organizations, including the US Embassy, to secure continued funding for human rights activities. Despite civil society’s growing concerns, Koy Vanny, spokesperson for the Ministry of Health, downplayed the situation, assuring that other donors would step in to fill the gap. “We are not abandoning our work, and we are not worried because we have partners around us,” he stated.

(CamboJA/Pring Samrang) Huot Chan Yuda, director of the National Centre for Tuberculosis and Leprosy Control (CENAT), said despite the aid termination by the US for technical assistance and funding for the TB program, the Ministry of Health’s National TB Control Program remains operational, with no impact on service accessibility. “The government has sufficient TB medicine and continues to provide essential equipment for timely diagnosis,” he added. Government spokesperson Pen Bona stated that it is within the rights of the US government to make such decisions. While the Cambodian government does not wish to see this happen, it is prepared to seek alternative partners to continue project implementation without abandoning them. However, he did not respond to the question regarding how the government would address civil society organizations working on children’s issues seeking assistance to fill the gap. Khuon Vichheka, spokesperson for the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport, and the US Embassy in Phnom Penh did not provide a comment. An analysis by the Business and Human Rights Law Group (BHRLG) of US-funded aid projects in Cambodia from January 2020 to January 2025, using data from the official US government spending database , found that over $371 million in US aid was distributed across 185 projects during this period. In fiscal year 2023, the United States allocated $72 billion in foreign aid globally, supporting projects in areas such as women’s health in conflict zones, clean water access, HIV/AIDS treatment, energy security, and anti-corruption initiatives. 3,946 views",

Tensions flared again along the Cambodia-Thailand border on Monday after Thailand launched air strikes in disputed areas, accusing Cambodian forces of opening fire on its troops and killing at least one soldier. Phnom Penh said Thai forces began the attacks early Monday in the An Ses area of Preah Vihear province, with the Defense Ministry saying Cambodian troops did not return fire and accusing Thailand of breaching an expanded ceasefire that Bangkok suspended last month. Hostilities followed an earlier outbreak of gunfire Sunday evening along the shared Sisaket-Preah Vihear border. The air strikes targeted only military infrastructure, including “weapon depots, command centers and logistical routes assessed as direct threats,” the Royal Thai Air Force said in a statement. Cambodia’s Ministry of National Defense said Thai forces continued ground assaults and air raids along the border as of its 11 a.m. press briefing, adding that civilians have been injured and their homes destroyed. The ministry’s spokesperson Maly Socheata said Thai forces also used tanks in the An Ses area, including near Ta Moan Thom and the Preah Vihear temple, flashpoints in a five-day border conflict in July, the deadliest outbreak of hostilities since a border spat began earlier this year, which killed dozens and temporarily displaced hundreds of thousands on both sides. Evacuations also ramped up on both sides of the border Monday. The Thai military said more than 385,000 civilians across four districts are being moved, with over 35,000 already in temporary shelters. In Cambodia, schools across the border provinces of Preah Vihear, Oddar Meanchey and Banteay Meanchey have been closed. Official figures on evacuations in Cambodia have not yet been released, but residents in Samroang city and nearby villages in Oddar Meanchey, as well as frontier communities in Preah Vihear, were seen fleeing their homes once more amid renewed clashes, continuing a pattern of displacement during past flare-ups since a ceasefire brokered by U.S. President Donald Trump and Malaysia as ASEAN chair. Senate President and longtime Cambodian leader Hun Sen called on all frontline forces to exercise restraint, writing on Facebook that Thai troops fired to provoke Cambodia into responding and “destroy the ceasefire.” Phnom Penh also said the ASEAN Observer Team, a group of regional military attaches deployed to Cambodia and Thailand to monitor the ceasefire, has been notified of the strikes. 8 views",

            "content": "U.S. President Donald J. Trump announced his departure en route to Malaysia, where he will oversee the signing of a landmark peace agreement between Cambodia and Thailand. This high-stakes diplomatic event comes amid escalating tensions following a serious border conflict earlier this year. Trump, who played a pivotal role in brokering this peace deal, stated he will sign the agreement “immediately” upon his arrival in Malaysia ahead of the ASEAN Summit 2025. The announcement was made via his social media platform, Truth Social, while aboard Air Force One. “ I am on my way to Malaysia, where I will sign the great Peace Deal, which I proudly brokered between Cambodia and Thailand. Sadly, the Queen Mother of Thailand has just passed away. I send my condolences to the Great People of Thailand. I will be seeing their wonderful Prime Minister when we land. In order to accommodate everyone for this major event, we will be signing the Peace Deal immediately upon arrival. See you soon! ” Trump posted. The long-standing border dispute between Thailand and Cambodia intensified in July this year, culminating in a five-day clash that resulted in casualties and displacement of thousands on both sides. A ceasefire mediated by Malaysia was implemented in late July, with ASEAN observers overseeing the truce. Following recent developments, Thailand and Cambodia agreed to accelerate efforts to demarcate their shared boundary. A two-day meeting of the Joint Boundary Commission (JBC) in Chanthaburi, Thailand, concluded on October 22 with several key agreements aimed at advancing the land demarcation process. Both nations committed to immediate measures, including the replacement of 15 Boundary Pillars at designated locations, to facilitate border resolution. Thailand’s Foreign Minister Sihasak Phuangketkeow highlighted the nearing completion of the border resolution, stating, “The ceremony will be witnessed by U.S. President Donald Trump, Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, and other ASEAN leaders.” Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet expressed optimism about ongoing cooperation, emphasizing the shared commitment to peaceful demarcation through dialogue and technical cooperation. Chea Lam, Minister in charge of the State Secretariat of Border Affairs and Co-Chairman of the Cambodian side headed the Cambodian delegation, while the Thai delegation was led by Prasas Prasasvinitchai, Advisor to the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Co-Chairman of the Thai side.

            "content": "Cambodia Investment Revew President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr. highlighted the deepening economic partnership between the Philippines and Cambodia during the recently concluded CEO B2B Networking Roundtable at Raffles Hotel Le Royal. The event, held on September 8, 2025 as part of his three-day State Visit to Cambodia, brought together top executives, investors, and policymakers from both nations to explore new opportunities for trade, investment, and collaboration. Jointly organized by the Department of Trade and Industry, the Cambodia Chamber of Commerce, and the Philippine Chamber of Commerce & Business Association in Cambodia, the high-level forum served as a platform for forging stronger business linkages and advancing bilateral economic goals. Steady Growth and Strengthening Trust In his keynote address, President Marcos noted the consistent upward trend in bilateral trade since 2022. He reported that in 2024, total trade between the two countries reached USD 105.69 million, underscoring both the growing demand for each other’s goods and services and the rising level of trust between their business communities. Read More: OCIC & WCC-ATC to Launch Aviation School in Cambodia “This growth reflects not only the increasing vitality and complementarity of our economies, but also the rising level of trust between our business communities,” he said, attributing the progress to trade facilitation, policy alignment, and stronger private sector engagement. The President also recalled key milestones in the relationship, including his 2022 visit to Cambodia and the recent visit of Prime Minister Hun Manet to the Philippines. He described these exchanges as “pivotal in renewing bilateral ties” and as laying the foundation for a more strategic, forward-looking partnership. Expanding Beyond Traditional Industries President Marcos urged business leaders to tap into untapped potential, stressing that the future of PH–Cambodia cooperation lies not only in established sectors but also in emerging high-impact industries, including: • Consumer goods • Education • Healthcare • Franchising • Infrastructure • Agro-processing • Logistics “These industries are critical drivers for both economic modernization and social development,” he said, noting that they align with national development priorities and global trends in innovation, sustainability, and digital transformation. Private Sector as the Engine of Growth Reaffirming the Philippine government’s commitment to fostering an enabling business environment, President Marcos emphasized the central role of the private sector in driving economic progress. “The private sector mobilizes capital, creates jobs, introduces technology, and delivers lasting impact,” he said. “We are fully prepared to work with you in transforming ideas into tangible results. Your efforts are at the forefront of this partnership, and we stand beside you in laying the foundations for shared growth and opportunity.” Looking Ahead to ASEAN 2026 The President also called on business leaders to support the Philippines as it prepares to assume the Chairmanship of ASEAN in 2026, describing it as a defining moment for the region. “We are committed to working closely with Cambodia and all our ASEAN partners to advance the shared aspirations that bind us as a community—striving towards a more prosperous and unified ASEAN that will serve the interests of our peoples and rise to the challenges of an ever-changing world,” he said. A Strategic Platform for Action Far from being a ceremonial gathering, the CEO B2B Networking Roundtable served as a strategic platform for meaningful engagement, enabling participants to exchange insights, forge partnerships, and identify concrete projects that can generate jobs, stimulate investment, and promote inclusive growth. As the State Visit progresses, both governments and their private sectors appear ready to translate goodwill into measurable outcomes, marking another step toward a new era of Philippines–Cambodia economic cooperation—one anchored in trust, innovation, and shared prosperity.",

            "content": "Cambodia Investment Review The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has revised down its growth projections for Cambodia, citing mounting challenges from border tensions with Thailand and persistent uncertainty over U.S. trade policy. Cambodia’s economy is now expected to expand 4.9% in 2025, down from the 6.1% forecast in April, while the 2026 outlook has been trimmed to 5.0% from 6.2% Industrial Sector Remains Key Driver Despite the downgrade, ADB said the Kingdom’s economy has shown resilience through the first half of 2025, supported by moderating inflation and robust industrial performance. Read More: ADB and SERC Launch 10-Year Securities Masterplan to Tackle Market Challenges Garment exports surged 22.2% year-on-year in the first six months, buoyed in part by U.S. buyers stocking up ahead of tariff adjustments. A more favorable 19% U.S. tariff rate, introduced in August, is expected to keep momentum steady in both garment and non-garment manufacturing Non-garment exports also expanded nearly 9%, led by electrical cables, wood-based products, and bicycles. Overall, industry is projected to grow 7.9% this year before strengthening further to 8.3% in 2026. Services and Tourism Under Pressure Services growth, however, is expected to slow sharply to 2.8% in 2025 and 2.6% in 2026. While Chinese visitor numbers have boosted tourism recovery, ongoing tensions with Thailand are hitting cross-border travel. Arrivals from Thailand dropped more than 60% in June compared with last year, a setback for a market that accounted for around a third of Cambodia’s total visitors in 2024. Agriculture and Inflation Trends Agriculture is forecast to expand modestly by 1.1% in both 2025 and 2026, supported by steady demand for exports such as cashew nuts and milled rice. Returning migrant laborers from Thailand are also expected to support growth in the sector. Inflation has eased significantly, falling from 6% in January to 1.6% in June. ADB expects consumer price growth to average around 2% through 2025 and 2026, helped by softer food prices and declining fuel costs Fiscal and External Balances The government’s budget deficit is projected to widen to $1.5 billion, or 3.1% of GDP, in 2025, driven by higher spending on defense and social programs linked to border tensions. The gap is expected to narrow gradually under the 2026–2028 fiscal framework. Meanwhile, foreign direct investment inflows rose 6.1% year-on-year in the first quarter of 2025 to $1 billion, while reserves climbed to $24.8 billion by midyear, covering nearly eight months of imports Risks Ahead ADB cautioned that Cambodia’s outlook faces downside risks from weaker growth in advanced economies, prolonged border disputes, and global trade policy uncertainty. High private debt levels also remain a vulnerability. “Cambodia’s economy continues to show resilience,” said Jyotsana Varma, ADB’s Country Director for Cambodia. “Industry remains the growth engine, while recovery in construction, tourism, and agriculture could help rebalance expansion in the coming years.”",

            "content": "Cambodia Investment Review A new policy brief from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) warns that while the United States’ 19% tariff on Cambodian imports is currently manageable, any escalation could threaten growth, jobs, and poverty reduction efforts across the Kingdom’s export-driven economy. The brief, Economic Impacts of the United States Tariff on Cambodia , developed in partnership with the Cambodia Development Resource Institute, models the effects of three possible tariff levels—low (10%), medium (19%), and high (36%)—on Cambodia’s economy. Moderate Tariffs, Manageable Impact ADB’s simulation shows that the 19% tariff, introduced in August 2025 following bilateral talks with Washington, will have minimal effects on economic stability in the near term. However, a 36% rate would reduce economic growth by nearly one percentage point, potentially leaving more than 100,000 people jobless and pushing the national poverty rate up by more than one percentage point. Read More: ADB Approves $82.5 Million Program to Boost Cambodia’s Clean Energy Transition and SME Investment in Efficiency Technologies “Government and industry experts have been monitoring the situation closely for months,” said Milan Thomas, ADB Country Economist for Cambodia and lead author of the brief. “Economic modelling confirms that the current tariff is indeed manageable, while demonstrating that a higher tariff would have dire consequences for Cambodian families through unemployment and poverty.” Garment and Electronics Sectors Most Exposed The ADB study underscores that Cambodia’s garment and electronics industries would be hit hardest by a steeper tariff, given their heavy reliance on U.S. export markets. Workers displaced from these sectors would likely shift into lower-paying jobs in agriculture or basic services, eroding household incomes and reversing recent gains in poverty reduction. Cambodia’s export sector, a key engine of growth, employs hundreds of thousands and contributes significantly to national GDP. Any disruption in trade flows to the U.S.—one of Cambodia’s largest markets—would reverberate across supply chains, particularly in provinces where manufacturing is concentrated. Policy Recommendations for Stability The policy brief advises the government to prepare targeted relief measures in case of future tariff escalation. These include short-term interventions such as social assistance, employment services, and upskilling programs to help affected workers transition between industries. For the longer term, ADB stresses that strengthening competitiveness through continued investment in infrastructure, human capital, and regulatory reform will be critical to sustaining resilience. Diversifying export markets and promoting higher-value manufacturing are also seen as essential to cushioning the economy against external shocks. Broader Economic Context The analysis, conducted with economic modelling support from Victoria University’s Centre of Policy Studies and using household survey data from Cambodia’s National Institute of Statistics, situates the tariff issue within Cambodia’s broader development trajectory. While Cambodia has diversified its trade partners in recent years—expanding links with China, the European Union, and ASEAN—its export profile remains heavily concentrated in garments, footwear, and light manufacturing, much of which is U.S.-bound. ADB’s findings suggest that maintaining policy flexibility and promoting private-sector adaptability will be vital as global trade dynamics shift. The Asian Development Bank, established in 1966 and owned by 69 member countries, remains a key partner in Cambodia’s economic transformation. It continues to support inclusive and sustainable growth through projects focused on infrastructure, innovation, and social protection—critical tools as the country navigates an increasingly uncertain global trade environment.",

            "content": "Cambodia Investment Review The World Bank has urged countries in East Asia and the Pacific, including Cambodia, to increase investment in workforce skills, job creation, and digital infrastructure to avoid rising poverty and long-term economic stagnation. The warning comes as the region’s growth outlook weakens amid global trade tensions, automation, and lower consumer confidence. Regional Growth Outlook Weakens In its latest regional economic update, the World Bank reported that East Asia and Pacific (EAP) economies continue to grow faster than the global average but are expected to slow further in 2025 and 2026. The slowdown reflects weaker business sentiment, lower export orders, and uneven consumer recovery following the pandemic. Read More: World Bank Approves $105 Million Project to Boost Early Learning in Cambodia The report noted that while the region’s export-driven model had lifted millions out of poverty over the past three decades, it now faces mounting challenges from protectionist trade measures and rapid technological change. Many workers across ASEAN remain in low-productivity or informal sectors, with a growing share at risk of slipping back into poverty. Cambodia Faces Structural Challenges Cambodia’s economic growth forecast has been revised down to 4.0% for 2025, compared with 5.5% previously projected in June and 5.4% recorded in 2024. The downgrade reflects weaker external demand, limited diversification, and slower investment inflows. The rate remains below the 7% annual growth level recommended by the United Nations for least developed countries to meet sustainable development goals. The World Bank highlighted that Cambodia’s reliance on garment and footwear exports makes it particularly vulnerable to trade volatility. While export tariffs to the United States were recently reduced to 19% from previous highs of up to 49%, global trade uncertainty and automation risks are expected to limit gains. The garment, footwear, and travel goods industry currently employs nearly one million workers, but ongoing automation across regional manufacturing hubs is expected to reshape job markets and displace low-skilled labor. Many young Cambodian men work as Tuk Tuk drivers in Phnom Penh. Informal Employment and Labor Market Risks The World Bank report emphasized that over 88% of Cambodia’s workforce remains in informal employment with limited access to benefits or social protection. This high level of informality constrains productivity and limits the country’s ability to move up the value chain. Labor experts have noted that Cambodia’s economy still depends heavily on low-skilled employment in factories and construction. The recent return of approximately 900,000 migrant workers following a border dispute with Thailand has further added pressure on the domestic labor market. Although some factories have resumed hiring to absorb returning workers, there are growing concerns that the lack of advanced technical and digital skills will limit reemployment opportunities. Non-performing loans have risen to 7% of total gross loans, the second highest among East Asia and Pacific nations, adding to existing vulnerabilities in Cambodia’s financial sector. Government Expands Vocational and Digital Initiatives In response to these challenges, the Cambodian government has intensified efforts to strengthen human capital through vocational and technical training. The Ministry of Labor and Vocational Training has introduced programs in electricity, construction, technology, and tourism, training hundreds of thousands of workers nationwide. Between 2024 and 2028, the ministry aims to expand its initiatives to 45 programs across 37 vocational schools, focusing on higher-value industries such as electronics and mechanical manufacturing. Companies like MinebeaMitsumi, which operates an assembly plant in Phnom Penh, are cited as examples of new industrial diversification efforts. The Ministry of Economy and Finance is also prioritizing investment in digital infrastructure and workforce development to support growth and competitiveness. Government officials have indicated that supporting returning migrant workers and creating new employment opportunities will remain central to maintaining social and economic stability. Cambodia’s future growth trajectory will depend on its ability to transition from a low-skilled, labor-intensive economy to one that embraces digital transformation, industrial diversification, and higher-value job creation.",

            "content": "Cambodia Investment Review Cambodia has secured a three-year partnership with the United Kingdom aimed at strengthening its regulatory framework and boosting investment, with both sides formalizing the initiative through a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed this week. The agreement is part of the UK-ASEAN Economic Integration Programme , delivered by the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office alongside the UK’s Office of Product Safety and Standards. The programme supports ASEAN members in developing transparent, evidence-based regulations to foster sustainable growth. Supporting Cambodia’s Reform Agenda The new initiative, titled “Supporting Regulatory Impact Assessment Reform,” will focus on embedding Regulatory Impact Assessments (RIA) into Cambodia’s policymaking process. RIA is designed to help governments assess the economic, social, and environmental impacts of proposed laws, enabling policymakers to make better-informed decisions. Read More: Leader Talks – Marc Thayre on His Tenure as Deputy Head of Mission, British Embassy Cambodia Officials said the move is intended to improve governance, reduce regulatory burdens, and ensure new regulations deliver tangible benefits to both businesses and society. Cambodia has made regulatory reform a priority as it seeks to create a more transparent and predictable business environment, in line with the government’s broader reform agenda. British Ambassador to Cambodia, Dominic Williams MBE, described the partnership as part of the UK’s support for Cambodia’s upcoming graduation from Least Developed Country (LDC) status. He noted that strong regulatory systems are vital for government efficiency, economic growth, and investor confidence. “Good regulation doesn’t always make headlines, but when regulation goes wrong, the consequences can be severe — from financial losses to environmental damage to risks to human lives,” Williams said. “This makes the UK proud to be working with Cambodia on this critical reform.” A Push Toward Transparency and Investment From Cambodia’s side, Permanent Deputy Prime Minister Vongsey Vissoth welcomed the agreement, calling it an important step in advancing regulatory reform and strengthening the country’s institutions. He emphasized that smart drafting of laws and regulations is central to the Royal Government’s efforts to create a more investor-friendly climate. “This MoU clearly states that it is a step toward achieving a key milestone in the Royal Government of Cambodia’s reform agenda, promoting the smart drafting of laws, regulations, and other legal documents, and building stronger institutions and rules,” Vissoth said. The UK’s support is also expected to enhance Cambodia’s attractiveness to foreign investors by improving the ease of doing business and aligning local regulations with international best practices. Regional Impact The initiative comes as Cambodia looks to deepen its integration with ASEAN and prepare for greater global competition after its planned LDC graduation. Regulatory alignment with international standards is seen as a key factor in attracting new capital and ensuring resilience in the face of economic challenges. The partnership reflects the UK’s broader strategy of supporting ASEAN’s regional integration while promoting sustainable development across member states.",

            "content": "Cambodia Investment Review Mekong Strategic Capital (MSC) has released its latest Cambodia Economic Update – A Two-Speed Economy? for December 2025 , highlighting an increasingly divided economic landscape. While manufacturing and domestic consumption are showing strong resilience, sectors such as tourism, property, and financial services are facing ongoing pressure. This divergence is shaping a more complex recovery path than many had anticipated earlier in the year. Manufacturing and Consumption Remain the Core Drivers The report shows Cambodia’s economic outlook improving modestly from earlier projections, with expected GDP growth of around 4% for both 2025 and 2026. Upward revisions are driven primarily by the sustained performance of manufacturing and a stronger-than-expected rebound in consumption. Exports—excluding gold—have grown above 15% year-to-date, reflecting solid expansion across factories and supply chains. Imports of machinery and electrical equipment have also surged, signalling new investment cycles within production-heavy sectors. MSC interprets this as a positive indicator for Cambodia’s competitiveness in labour-intensive manufacturing. On the domestic front, VAT and excise collections have rebounded sharply, reversing last year’s contraction and pointing toward renewed household spending. Vehicle imports have risen significantly, further supporting the view that consumer confidence and purchasing power are stabilising. Tourism Slowdown and Remittance Shock Weigh on Short-Term Growth The report notes continued weakness in the tourism sector, with reputational issues linked to scam centres and the Thai border conflict pushing arrivals downward. Angkor Wat ticket sales have fallen by about 20% in recent months, and visitor numbers from East Asia—traditionally one of Cambodia’s strongest markets—remain far below pre-pandemic levels. At the same time, the sudden return of more than 900,000 Cambodian migrant workers from Thailand is creating an additional economic burden. The loss of over US$1 billion in remittances is already affecting household incomes, while job absorption has been slow due to mismatches in skills, location, and industry demand. MSC warns that these dynamics will continue to exert pressure on the labour market and consumption, particularly in rural areas. Property Market Weakness Continues to Feed Financial-Sector Stress The property sector remains one of the most challenging parts of the economy. Residential oversupply now stretches to roughly a decade of inventory, while transaction volumes remain weak. This slowdown is reflected within the banking sector, where approximately 17.5% of all loans have either been restructured or are in arrears. Although some easing in restructuring activity has been observed, MSC cautions that banks may still need to liquidate property-backed collateral, potentially extending financial tightening well into next year. This could also weigh on sentiment among developers and homebuyers, delaying a broader recovery. A Two-Speed Outlook Heading Into 2026 Key considerations and recommendations highlighted by MSC Manufacturing, consumption, and capital imports are expected to remain the country’s most reliable growth drivers. Tourism recovery is likely to stay uneven without coordinated efforts to address reputational issues and regional confidence. The return of migrant workers will require targeted employment programs focused on skills alignment and geographic distribution. Property and banking pressures may persist unless inventory levels fall and collateral restructuring stabilises. MSC recommends that Cambodia utilise its strong fiscal position to introduce temporary, targeted stimulus—particularly in job creation, tourism promotion, and sectoral support. Demographic trends remain a long-term advantage, with growth in the working-age population expected to underpin economic potential for decades. Long-Term Fundamentals Remain Supportive Despite near-term challenges, MSC underscores Cambodia’s structural strengths. The country’s demographic outlook is one of the most favourable in the region, and public debt levels remain low, offering significant fiscal flexibility. Combined with ongoing investment in manufacturing capacity, these factors position Cambodia for stronger medium- to long-term growth once immediate pressures begin to ease. MSC concludes that Cambodia’s economic path entering 2026 will continue to be shaped by a blend of resilience in some sectors and fragility in others. Strategic policy choices over the next year—particularly around employment absorption, banking stability, and tourism recovery—will determine how quickly the economy can close the gap between its two speeds.",

Marcos Jr. has begun a three-day State Visit to Cambodia, underscoring a drive to deepen economic ties and attract investment as both countries look to expand trade and regional cooperation. Arriving in Phnom Penh on Sunday, September 7, Marcos was accompanied by First Lady Louise Araneta-Marcos and a high-level delegation. The visit is seen as a key step in strengthening bilateral relations ahead of the Philippines’ ASEAN Chairmanship in 2026, and comes as Cambodia positions itself as an emerging hub for regional trade and investment. Economic Priorities at the Center Marcos is scheduled to meet Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet for a wide-ranging bilateral dialogue that will prioritize economic and business-focused cooperation. Talks will center on: Diversifying trade and investment flows between the two economies Expanding air services and tourism exchanges to drive connectivity and visitor arrivals Collaboration in agriculture and higher education , sectors identified as strategic growth areas Joint measures against transnational crimes , including human trafficking, to safeguard cross-border trade and labor mobility The Philippine delegation is also seeking Cambodian support for Manila’s preparations to chair ASEAN in 2026, with Marcos expected to frame deeper integration as a pathway to regional growth. Business Engagement and Investment Push As part of the program, Marcos will host a roundtable with Filipino and Cambodian business leaders to highlight investment opportunities and encourage partnerships with Philippine firms. The discussions are expected to focus on infrastructure, services, and agriculture — areas where Cambodian demand aligns with Philippine expertise and capacity. “We are working with Cambodia so that together we can grow our economy,” Marcos said in Filipino, emphasizing his intent to attract Cambodian investors to the Philippines while reinforcing two-way investment flows. Strengthening Bilateral Foundations The visit also builds on nearly seven decades of diplomatic relations since ties were established in 1957. It marks the first official trip to Cambodia by a Philippine president since 2016, and follows Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet’s state visit to Manila earlier this year. With Cambodia ranking as one of ASEAN’s fastest-growing economies and the Philippines seeking to diversify its trade partners amid global uncertainty, analysts view the visit as a timely opportunity to align economic strategies. Both governments are expected to outline follow-up mechanisms to translate commitments into actionable projects. People-to-People Links While the visit includes engagements with senior Cambodian leaders, Marcos also placed emphasis on the Filipino community, announcing the opening of a Migrant Workers Office in Phnom Penh to provide welfare support and legal assistance to the estimated 7,500 Filipinos in Cambodia. Officials say the move reflects Manila’s dual-track approach: ensuring the welfare of overseas Filipinos while positioning them as bridges for stronger bilateral trade and investment ties.",

            "content": "Cambodia Investment Review Cambodia’s post-pandemic momentum is losing pace as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) warns of a slowdown in economic growth and elevated financial vulnerabilities. In its 2025 Article IV Consultation completed on November 21, the IMF projects GDP growth to moderate to 4.8 percent in 2025 and around 4.0 percent in 2026, compared with 6.0 percent in 2024. The IMF notes in its 2025 Article IV Consultation with Cambodia that softening domestic demand, declining remittances, a slowdown in tourism and tariff-related pressures on export margins are weighing on consumption and investment. These shifts come despite a strong performance in the first half of 2025 following a solid rebound in exports and tourism throughout 2024. Read More: IMF Concluded 2025 Mission: Urges Cambodia to Boost Fiscal Buffers, Strengthen Banks, and Accelerate Reforms as Growth Slows Snapshot of IMF observations • Growth slowing due to export volatility and weaker domestic demand • Financial sector vulnerabilities remain central to downside risks • Fiscal support should be temporary and targeted while preserving prudence • Monetary policy encouraged to normalise gradually with clear communication Economic momentum fades in second half of 2025 Following 6.0 percent GDP growth in 2024 driven by a rebound in garment and agricultural exports and continued tourism recovery, nowcasting estimates in early 2025 pointed to year-on-year growth of 6.2 percent. However, by mid-year, emerging shocks—including border tensions and trade uncertainty—began to expose existing structural weaknesses. The slowdown in remittances is limiting household spending, while manufacturers are grappling with rising input costs as tariff effects filter through supply chains. The IMF cautions that risks remain firmly tilted to the downside. Prolonged export disruption, weakened investor confidence from renewed border tensions and rising non-performing loans could amplify pressures if the recovery softens further. IMF calls for calibrated fiscal and monetary responses The IMF’s Executive Board advises policymakers to balance near-term stimulus with long-term discipline. Temporary and targeted fiscal measures to support affected households and displaced workers are recommended, followed by gradual consolidation aimed at rebuilding fiscal buffers. Reinforcing domestic revenue mobilization and improving expenditure efficiency—especially governance of large infrastructure projects—are identified as medium-term priorities. On monetary policy, the IMF recommends a gradual return of reserve-requirement ratios to pre-pandemic levels as conditions allow, alongside continued improvements in liquidity management and a stronger monetary transmission mechanism in Khmer Riel. Clear and transparent communication is emphasized to maintain policy credibility. Strengthening financial oversight and accelerating structural reforms The IMF highlights the need to reinforce financial supervision as private debt and non-performing loans rise. The planned phase-out of regulatory forbearance by end-2025 is considered necessary to ensure proper loan classification and recapitalisation where needed. The report also calls for upgrades to supervisory capacity, crisis-management and insolvency frameworks, and continued progress toward a deposit-insurance scheme and improved AML/CFT compliance. Long-term resilience, according to the IMF, will depend on accelerating structural reforms aimed at export diversification, productivity growth, and enhanced governance. Better investment facilitation and improved data availability are seen as critical to maintaining competitiveness and investor confidence. Although challenges remain, the IMF notes that upside opportunities persist through deeper regional trade and investment integration and if returning workers are successfully absorbed into the domestic labour market.",

            "content": "Cambodia Investment Review Cambodia has approved a draft 2026 national budget worth US$10.2 billion, up 7% from the US$9.3 billion allocated in 2025, marking one of the country’s largest year-on-year increases in spending over the past decade. The proposal, endorsed during a cabinet meeting led by Prime Minister Hun Manet, is designed to strengthen national sovereignty and institutional capacity while supporting social and economic reforms. The budget comes at a time when the government is managing lower revenue growth, rising expenditure demands and the gradual rebuilding of national savings depleted during the COVID-19 period. The 2026 spending package represents 18.9% of GDP, aligning with Cambodia’s Medium-Term Public Finance Framework for 2026–2028, which aims to balance economic expansion with debt sustainability and sector reforms. Focus on sovereignty, security and reform momentum A key feature of the draft budget is a stronger emphasis on territorial protection, national security and institutional resilience. Policymakers describe stable sovereignty as an essential foundation for investor confidence, tourism and long-term growth. Beyond security, the plan prioritizes continued reforms in public administration efficiency, governance and productivity-oriented sectors. Read More: EU Backs €3.5M Drive to Close Cambodia’s Budget Transparency Gap Human capital development also remains high on the agenda, with expected allocations toward social protection, sectoral improvement and education. The government projects economic growth of 5.2% in 2025 and around 5.0% in 2026, driven by gains across industry, services and agriculture, with fisheries and animal husbandry expected to perform strongly inside the agricultural category. Managing rising expenditure and tightening revenue The increase in spending raises questions about how the government will finance expanding obligations across defense, pensions, social protection programs, investment incentives and debt servicing. Economists recommend closer auditing of upcoming ministerial budgets to ensure that only essential and high-return initiatives move forward. Analysts stress that ministries contributing directly to national revenue and production will need to improve efficiency and output. Without these measures, a revenue shortfall could emerge, increasing dependency on external borrowing. Borrowing outlook grows, with focus on infrastructure To support public investment projects, Cambodia plans to borrow US$3.1 billion in 2026, a 12.5% increase from the previous year’s ceiling of US$2.6 billion. Borrowing is expected to target large-scale infrastructure and productivity-enhancing development projects, viewed as critical for long-term competitiveness. Read More: Cambodia Urged to Create Jobs, Ease Debt, and Boost SME and Agro-Processing Sectors to Reintegrate Nearly One Million Returnees As of mid-2025, Cambodia’s total public debt stood at US$12.67 billion, of which 99% was external and 1% domestic. According to multilateral institutions, the country’s public debt remains “manageable” and “low risk”, although economists note that borrowing has grown at a faster pace in recent years and stress the importance of transparency, oversight and anti-corruption safeguards to prevent future debt stress. Loan allocation trends continue to be dominated by infrastructure: in the second quarter of 2025, 87% of new loans funded infrastructure projects, while 13% supported non-infrastructure development. Next steps and expectations The draft budget now moves to the National Assembly for discussion, followed by Senate review and a final signature from King Norodom Sihamoni. If approved, the 2026 budget will take effect on January 1. The success of the budget will depend on multiple factors: the government’s ability to manage spending efficiency, sustain revenue growth, borrow responsibly and implement reforms at the institutional level. Economists note that maintaining confidence among investors, development partners and the private sector will be key to balancing increased spending with long-term fiscal sustainability.",

The G-PSF was established in 1999 under the wise initiative of Samdech Akka Moha Sena Padei Techo Hun Sen , former Prime Minister and the current President of the Senate of the Kingdom of Cambodia, to promote private sector development and economic rehabilitation, and empower the private sector to become a driving force for economic growth.

The reportdetails progress across priority reform areas, including trade, tourism, infrastructure, taxation, customs, agriculture and regulatory streamlining. It also provides an overview of the implementation progress of the reform measures introduced at the 19th G-PSF across relevant ministries, institutions, and working groups. With 93% of the measures completed and the remaining 7% in progress, the implementation is advancing steadily towards the 20th G‑PSF Plenary, anticipated in 2026. The report also highlights the progress made in resolving issues raised across the 16 Working Groups. H.E. Sun Chanthol, Deputy Prime Minister, First Vice Chairman of the CDC and Chairman of the Coordinating Committee H.E. Sun Chanthol said, ‘As we celebrate 25 years of the G-PSF, this mechanism is more important than ever. In the face of new regional challenges – including shifts in global trade – it helps to strengthen institutions and support the private sector to reach its potential as Cambodia’s engine of growth. We look forward to continuing to develop the G-PSF and ensuring productive G-PSF Working Group dialogues.’ H.E. Derek Yip , Australian Ambassador to the Kingdom of Cambodia, said, ‘Australia supports robust, evidence-based policy making and inclusive dialogue. We appreciate the efforts of the CDC and the Cambodian Chamber of Commerce (CCC) to engage constructively in this vital forum that facilitates policy dialogue to drive Cambodia’s economic development’. Helping To Present Business Sector Perspectives & Recommendations The CCC plays a valuable role in coordinating the private sector side of the G-PSF, helping to present business sector perspectives and recommendations to the Royal Government of Cambodia. Enabling private sector’s contributions in the economy is key to achieve economic and development outcomes. Australia began its engagement with the G-PSF in 2002, providing institutional assistance to the G-PSF Secretariat alongside the International Finance Corporation. Australia renewed this partnership in 2023 through the Cambodia Australia Partnership for Resilient Economic Development (CAPRED). This support extends to the CDC, CCC, and 16 G-PSF Working Groups and focuses on enhancing the capacity of relevant G-PSF stakeholders to deliver timely and accountable reform. The workshop included participants from the 16 G-PSF Working Groups—both public and private sector members, the CCC, embassies, international chambers, business associations and development partners.",

            "content": "Cambodia Investment Review A new joint policy report by the Cambodia Development Resource Institute (CDRI) and the Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia (ERIA) has called for urgent action to create jobs, ease household debt, and expand SME and agro-processing sectors to reintegrate nearly one million Cambodians returning from Thailand. The report, titled “Proposed Programme of Intervention to Integrate Cambodian Returnees into the Cambodian Economy,” outlines both immediate and medium-term policy recommendations designed to stabilise incomes, support vulnerable households, and accelerate industrial diversification. The recommendations build on close consultations with 19 government ministries, development partners, and the private sector. Managing an Unprecedented Return of Workers According to the report, around 910,000 Cambodians — nearly 10% of the national labour force — have returned home since July 2025 following the escalation of border tensions with Thailand. The majority are of working age (18–40 years old), with limited formal education and significant debt burdens. Read More: Yuanta Securities Report: Reintegration of Returning Migrant Workers Could Add $8 Billion to Cambodia’s GDP by 2030 Before returning, 42% of these workers were employed in construction, 15% in agriculture, and 12% in services, earning average remittances of about US$400 per month. With those earnings gone, household debt averaging US$5,000–8,000 from formal lenders and US$2,500 from informal sources has placed many families at risk of default. Without swift intervention, the report warns, the poverty rate among returnee households could rise to 50%, underscoring the need for coordinated government measures. Short-Term Policy Actions: Jobs, Cash Transfers, and Debt Relief The report’s short-term (0–12 month) recommendations focus on income recovery, employment creation, and debt protection. A key proposal is the establishment of a Returnee Labour Database (RLD) managed by the Ministry of Labour and Vocational Training (MLVT) to register and profile returnees, linking them to job vacancies, training, and social protection systems. Under the plan, vulnerable households identified through the Identification of Poor Households (IDPoor) database would receive cash transfers via mobile platforms such as Wing and ABA Pay, while the National Social Security Fund (NSSF) would extend temporary health and pension coverage. The National Bank of Cambodia (NBC) has been urged to direct banks and microfinance institutions to reschedule repayments and suspend penalties, with the Credit Guarantee Corporation of Cambodia (CGCC) providing partial guarantees on restructured loans to prevent defaults. The report also recommends a nationwide cash-for-work programme to create 200,000–300,000 short-term jobs in rural road repair, irrigation rehabilitation, and school construction, with a 40% female participation target. Wages would be paid digitally to promote transparency and financial inclusion. Cambodia-Thailand borders – Cambodian workers return home as tensions mount. Medium-Term Priorities: Agro-Processing, SMEs, and Industrial Diversification Over the next one to three years, the report proposes shifting focus to self-employment and structural growth through targeted investment in agriculture, SMEs, and emerging industries. In agriculture, the expansion of agro-processing capacity for cassava, cashew, mango, and rice is expected to generate up to 70,000 jobs. New starch and ethanol plants, cashew processing clusters, and mango drying facilities are planned in high-output provinces such as Battambang, Kampong Thom, and Banteay Meanchey. The report also calls for a Returnee Enterprise Fund, providing grants of US$500–1,500 and CGCC-backed loans to help 50,000 returnees start small businesses. Complementary “micro-MBA” training in accounting, marketing, and e-commerce will be offered through provincial TVET centres, co-financed by the Skills Development Fund (SDF) under the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF). To further diversify the economy, the Council for the Development of Cambodia (CDC) will prioritise foreign direct investment (FDI) in sectors such as electronics, auto-parts manufacturing, renewable energy, and logistics, with potential to create more than 250,000 jobs. Building Infrastructure and Digital Systems To support reintegration, the report recommends the construction of logistics and cold-chain hubs in Stung Bot and Poipet, expansion of affordable housing, and upgrades to health and education services in border provinces. The RLD will evolve into a digital “skills passport” system to document workers’ experience and connect them with domestic and international employers. A multilingual grievance hotline and mobile app are also proposed to enhance worker protection and reporting of labour abuses. Economic Impact and Policy Alignment If fully implemented, the CDRI–ERIA programme could raise Cambodia’s GDP by nearly 10% over the medium term through employment generation, SME expansion, and debt stabilisation. “While the mass return of workers poses short-term challenges, it also presents an opportunity to strengthen Cambodia’s economic resilience and accelerate diversification,” said Dr. Eng Netra, Executive Director of CDRI. The policy recommendations align with the Royal Government of Cambodia’s Pentagonal Strategy Phase II, focusing on industrial transformation, digital inclusion, and sustainable job creation.",

            "content": "Cambodia Investment Review The United States Department of State has released its long-delayed 2025 Trafficking in Persons (TIP) report , which for the first time designates Cambodia as a “state sponsor” of human trafficking. The classification carries the possibility of sanctions and may affect the Kingdom’s investment climate at a time when foreign direct investment is increasingly important for economic growth. Business and Diplomatic Implications The report alleges that senior Cambodian government officials have profited from human trafficking by allowing properties they own to be used by online scam operators engaged in forced labor and forced criminality. This marks a significant escalation in how Cambodia is viewed internationally, aligning it with other countries identified as sponsors of trafficking such as Afghanistan, China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia. Read More: U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control Updates List for Cambodian and Burmese Entities: September 2025 From an investment perspective, the designation could complicate Cambodia’s economic ties with key partners, particularly the United States. Sanctions or increased scrutiny could limit access to capital, disrupt international banking relations, and raise compliance costs for companies doing business in or with Cambodia. Multinational corporations and financial institutions may become more cautious in their engagement, particularly those subject to strict US regulatory oversight. The 2025 TIP Report includes the following 13 countries. Regional Context and Market Outlook The TIP report’s findings come at a time when Cambodia is seeking to attract new foreign direct investment in sectors such as manufacturing, construction, real estate, and technology. While the country continues to position itself as a destination for regional trade and supply chain diversification, reputational risks linked to trafficking and online scam operations could become a barrier to investment flows. Neighboring ASEAN economies are also under scrutiny. The report placed Brazil and South Africa on a “watchlist” for insufficient efforts to combat trafficking, while Russia and China remain criticized for forced labor practices. Cambodia’s inclusion in the highest category of concern places it at the more severe end of the spectrum, which could affect regional perceptions of stability and governance. Impact on Investors and Next Steps For foreign investors, the key risks are likely to revolve around enhanced due diligence, reputational considerations, and potential sanctions compliance. Companies operating in Cambodia may face pressure from shareholders, regulators, and civil society groups to demonstrate transparency in their supply chains and labor practices. Cambodia’s response to the designation will be critical. Any government action to address the allegations—such as enforcement measures, regulatory reforms, or cooperation with international partners—could influence how markets and investors assess the long-term risks. Without such steps, Cambodia risks reduced investor confidence at a time when regional competition for capital is intensifying.",

            "content": "Cambodia Investment Review EuroCham Cambodia has released its Business Pulse H1 2025 Report , presenting a detailed snapshot of private-sector confidence amid regional uncertainty and global headwinds. The data-driven report outlines how border tensions, new trade tariffs, and shifting consumer sentiment have shaped business conditions across Cambodia’s leading industries, from financial services and agriculture to tourism and construction. Sector Sentiment Shifts in a Challenging Half-Year The latest survey of EuroCham members revealed that the first half of 2025 brought a tougher business environment overall. Real estate, construction, and service sectors reported declining revenues, while agriculture and tourism faced external shocks that disrupted supply chains and slowed momentum. Two developments had the most immediate economic impact: the Thailand–Cambodia border dispute, which hindered logistics and agricultural exports for nearly four in ten businesses, and the introduction of U.S. tariffs, which prompted delays in foreign investment and increased costs for exporters. Read More: 3rd Cambodia–Europe Dialogue Targets Infrastructure Investment, Red Tape Reduction, and Green Economy Reforms Despite these setbacks, Cambodia’s reputation as a stable investment destination improved slightly in early 2025. However, the report notes that many respondents remain hesitant to recommend new entrants into the market, citing ongoing uncertainty and weaker credit demand. Financial Services and Consumer Confidence Provide Stability According to Nicolas Hollanders, CEO of BRED Bank Cambodia, the financial sector has shown both resilience and warning signs. Outstanding loans rose just 2.9% year-on-year to $61.8 billion by June 2025, signaling softer demand — particularly in real estate and construction. Meanwhile, deposits climbed by 14.5% to $61.5 billion, indicating continued public confidence in the banking system. However, non-performing loans increased to around 8.3% from 7.4% at the end of 2024. “Liquidity and capital positions remain solid, but rising credit risk and slowing demand are becoming more of a concern,” Hollanders said. Tourism and Agriculture Lead Growth Momentum Cambodia’s tourism and hospitality industry recorded encouraging growth, driven by international arrivals and domestic travel. According to Catherine Germier-Hamel, Chair of EuroCham’s Tourism & Hospitality Committee, Cambodia welcomed about 3.36 million foreign tourists in H1 2025 — a 6.2% increase year-on-year. Angkor Archaeological Park alone received 567,673 visitors, generating $26.3 million in ticket sales. Hotel supply in Phnom Penh expanded by roughly 6%, and the upcoming Techo International Airport — set to open later this year — is expected to further boost arrivals. The agriculture and food processing sectors also delivered strong results. EuroCham Agribusiness Committee Chair Oknha Sovithya Sothy noted that crop exports grew 27% year-on-year to 7.83 million tonnes, generating $2.87 billion in revenue. Cashew nuts led export growth with a 56% increase, while fertilizer and equipment imports rose sharply — a sign of continued investment in productivity. “Food processing remains limited, but the government’s focus on value addition offers a major opportunity for future growth,” Sothy said. Outlook: Companies Shift Toward Efficiency and Cost Control Looking ahead, one-third of surveyed businesses plan to reduce operational costs in the second half of 2025. The most common measures include staff reductions (51%), marketing budget cuts (45%), and scaled-back training programs (26%). The U.S. dollar continues to dominate as Cambodia’s transaction currency, with declining use of the Khmer riel and euro. EuroCham Executive Director Martin Brisson said the findings highlight both challenges and opportunities for the private sector. “Access to reliable business information is essential for decision-making, yet firsthand data remains scarce in Cambodia. The Business Pulse offers critical insights into performance, confidence, and the evolving business environment,” he said. The full Business Pulse H1 2025 Report , including detailed sectoral analysis, policy recommendations, and investment outlooks, is available for download on the EuroCham Cambodia website.",

His appeal comes amid renewed clashes along the border, where Cambodia says Thai forces have begun using a range of weapons against its positions, raising fears that the ceasefire could falter if restraint is not upheld. Hun Sen called on soldiers stationed along the frontier to remain calm, stay on high alert, and avoid reacting to provocation, saying their discipline is essential to preventing the peace accord from collapsing. He also reaffirmed that Cambodian athletes will still compete at the 33rd SEA Games as planned. He warned that Thailand’s actions appeared aimed at drawing Cambodia into retaliation. “They want us to strike back so the ceasefire and the Kuala Lumpur peace accord will collapse,” he said, noting that a clear red line has been set for Cambodia’s response. Hun Sen instructed commanders to communicate this guidance thoroughly to forces at every level. In the same statement, he asked authorities to evacuate villagers from high-risk zones and move them to safer areas. Hun Sen added that he had cancelled his work schedule to coordinate directly with Prime Minister Hun Manet in overseeing the armed forces, describing the situation as a military incursion that required immediate and focused leadership. He confirmed that Cambodia’s delegation to the 33rd Southeast Asian Games in Thailand would proceed as planned. Border hostilities have escalated sharply, with fighting reported across several sections of the frontier. The National Defence Ministry said Thai troops opened fire on Cambodian units at 2:15 p.m. on December 7, then launched additional attacks later that night. That evening, Thai soldiers fired handguns at Cambodian troops in O’ Pkar Sne village before carrying out further assaults at Prolean Thmar using handguns and mortars. The attack ended at 8:50 p.m. In the early morning of December 8, Cambodian authorities reported new strikes by Thai forces on units stationed in the An Ses area of Preah Vihear province, around Tamoan Thom temple, in the 5 Makara zone near Preah Vihear Temple, and in the Chomka Chek area.",

His visit on Nov. 28 and 29 was at the invitation of Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Prak Sokhonn. Peters and Sokhonn held in-depth discussions on Nov. 29 aimed at advancing cooperation across various sectors, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation said. The ministers noted the importance of maintaining regular engagements at all levels to deepen political relations and identify additional areas of partnership. “They also welcomed the successful convening of the 3rd Foreign Ministries’ Consultations on 22 August 2025 in Wellington, New Zealand, and agreed to continue promoting this mechanism for regular dialogue,” the ministry said. On security matters, both recognized transnational crimes, including online scams, as serious threats to national security that require coordinated regional efforts. Therefore, they reaffirmed their strong commitment to strengthening security cooperation and agreed to work together to combat these crimes. On economic cooperation, both sides agreed that institutions from the two countries should step up efforts to unlock more potential in order to boost trade, particularly in agriculture, enhance investment flows, and promote economic complementarity. Additionally, the two ministers underscored the importance of tourism for fostering mutual understanding and economic growth, noting that people-to-people exchanges remain a key pillar of their relations. Sokhonn thanked New Zealand for the contributions to Cambodia’s peace process and post-conflict reconstruction since the early 1990s, particularly in mine clearance and human resource development. The New Zealand delegation commended Cambodia’s rapid economic and social progress and pledged continued support for the country’s development, the ministry said. Peters’ visit came a month after a meeting between Prime Minister Hun Manet and New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon on the sidelines of the 47th ASEAN Summit in Malaysia in October. In addition to bilateral issues, Sokhonn briefed Peters on recent progress in implementing the Kuala Lumpur Joint Declaration, signed between Cambodia and Thailand on Oct. 26. He reaffirmed Cambodia’s commitment to fulfilling its obligations under the agreement. Both sides also exchanged views on regional and international developments of mutual interest and reaffirmed their commitment to supporting each other’s core goals while promoting peace, stability, and prosperity through cooperation in international forums. Peters also met Prime Minister Hun Manet on Nov. 29, when both sides discussed trade, investment, education, agriculture, tourism and people-to-people exchanges for collaboration, and explored cooperation within regional and international frameworks. In terms of private-sector cooperation, Cambodia has established a representative office of the Cambodian Chamber of Commerce in New Zealand to help expand investment opportunities and promote trade. Cambodia and New Zealand established diplomatic relations in 1959, six years after Cambodia gained independence from France.",

The Ministry of National Defense announced on December 1 that the trip follows an invitation from Lao Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister General Khamlieng Outhakaysone. General Seiha will be accompanied by officials from the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces as part of the high-level mission. Laos will commemorate December 2 as the day the Lao People’s Democratic Republic was proclaimed in 1975. During the visit, General Seiha is also scheduled to pay a courtesy call on General Outhakaysone on the sidelines of the national festivities. The ministry said the visit aims to reinforce longstanding solidarity between the two militaries and their citizens, while paving the way for broader defense cooperation to support peace, stability, and sustainable development. General Seiha last traveled to Vientiane in mid-October to attend the four-day Cambodia–Laos–Vietnam Defense Ministers’ Meeting , where the three countries pledged to deepen regional security coordination and strengthen joint responses to natural disasters. To mark its golden jubilee , Laos has organized a large military parade, nationwide cultural events, and heightened security preparations. The parade will spotlight the country’s achievements over the past five decades and present Laos’ development path to domestic audiences and foreign partners. Across Laos, streets and public squares have been adorned with national and Party flags. In the capital, major monuments and sacred sites are also draped in bright colors, creating a distinctly festive and patriotic mood. Cambodia and Laos established diplomatic relations in 1956, and their bilateral ties have steadily expanded through regular exchanges between top leaders.

In a statement on Facebook, Anwar voiced deep alarm over the rapidly worsening situation after reports of fresh fighting along the frontier. He also offered condolences to the families of those killed or wounded. He cautioned that the renewed violence threatens to unravel years of careful work to steady relations between the two neighbors. Anwar, who mediated the July 24 Ceasefire Agreement and the October 26 Peace Accord, stressed that Cambodia and Thailand remain central to ASEAN. He urged both sides to show the highest degree of restraint. He emphasized the need to keep communication channels open and to rely on established mechanisms designed to defuse tensions, adding that Malaysia stands ready to support any effort that helps restore stability and prevent further incidents. He warned that the region cannot allow long-standing disagreements to harden into recurring cycles of confrontation. The immediate priority, he said, is to stop the fighting, protect civilians, and return to a diplomatic track grounded in international law and the neighborly principles that underpin ASEAN.

            "content": "ODDAR MEANCHEY – Families living along the Cambodian–Thai frontier are once again packing what they can carry and rushing to safer ground, as fresh fighting breaks out and fear ripples through villages that have already endured multiple waves of displacement this year. Villagers reported heavy shelling early December 8, describing a morning marked by panic and confusion. Soeurt Chantrea, a contract teacher in Koun Kriel commune, said the blasts shook her school just before 7 a.m. “The explosions were so loud they startled everyone. The children bolted from their seats, crying and shouting, and even the teachers struggled to stay calm,” she said. Some of her students, unable to get home because they had no bicycles, ran to her classroom and refused to leave. “I didn’t know how to comfort them. I felt powerless,” Chantrea said. She noted that the explosions continued throughout the morning near her home close to the O’Smach border checkpoint. “Each blast feels closer than the last. We still haven’t heard any response from our side,” she said. Her family is now preparing a tractor fitted with a small roof to evacuate her elderly grandmother. “Once it’s ready, we’ll head to Chong Kal district. That’s where we usually shelter when the fighting starts,” she said. In Banteay Ampil district, Yorth Om from Sen Monorom 2 village fled with her young family after shells landed near their home. They arrived at Phom Kambor campsite shortly after sunrise. “We left around seven in the morning. When we got here, thousands had already gathered, and more people keep pouring in,” she said. “We had only been back home for two weeks. Now we’re running again.” Samraong city has also seen scattered evacuations, though many residents continue to work and open their shops. Hotel receptionist Dourng Chhingpav said the tension is unmistakable. “Some people have left, but many are still here. We hear the explosions from time to time, but it’s not constant,” he said. More than 1,000 families have been reported to evacuate in Oddar Meanchey province alone, according to the provincial authorities. Meanwhile, the deputy governor of Preah Vihear province could not be reached for comment. The latest escalation followed a Thai military assault on the afternoon of December 7 in Preah Vihear province. Fighting resumed overnight in Oddar Meanchey, and a renewed attack early on December 8 forced thousands more to flee. Both sides have blamed each other for triggering the violence, while Cambodian officials maintain they have not fired back. Defense Ministry spokeswoman Lieutenant - General Maly Socheata said the Thai military used heavy weapons, including tanks. She confirmed that three Cambodian civilians were wounded and several homes burned as a result of the shelling. Thai authorities acknowledged the use of fighter jets in the operation. Amid widespread fear, humanitarian agencies have begun monitoring the situation. Dr. Will Parks, UNICEF Representative in Cambodia, said the agency is closely following developments. “UNICEF Cambodia is aware of reports of armed clashes along the Cambodia–Thailand border. We are closely monitoring the situation and working with the authorities to assess needs and provide essential support to affected families and children. Children must be protected at all times, and their safety and well-being must be prioritized,” he said. Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Civil Service Hun Many urged both countries to pull back from confrontation and return to dialogue. “Gunfire, artillery strikes, and fighter jets have shaken our people and created deep fear,” he said. He said images of families fleeing and children running from their classrooms should serve as a warning. “These scenes are heartbreaking,” he said. “Our people want peace. We have been clear from the start that this border issue must be settled through dialogue, not force. Let the world hear Cambodia’s call—for peace, for stability, and for the safety of both Cambodian and Thai communities.”",

            "content": "United Nations, United States--The United Nations on Monday hit out at global \"apathy\" over widespread suffering as it launched its 2026 appeal for humanitarian assistance, which is limited in scope as aid operations confront major funding cuts. \"This is a time of brutality, impunity and indifference,\" UN humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher told reporters, condemning \"the ferocity and the intensity of the killing, the complete disregard for international law, horrific levels of sexual violence\" he had seen on the ground in 2025. \"This is a time when the rules are in retreat, when the scaffolding of coexistence is under sustained attack, when our survival antennae have been numbed by distraction and corroded by apathy,\" he said. He said it was also a time \"when politicians boast of cutting aid,\" as he unveiled a streamlined plan to raise at least $23 billion to help 87 million people in the world's most dangerous places such as Gaza, Ukraine, Sudan, Haiti and Myanmar. The United Nations would like to ultimately raise $33 billion to help 135 million people in 2026 -- but is painfully aware that its overall goal may be difficult to reach, given US President Donald Trump's slashing of foreign aid. Fletcher said the \"highly prioritized appeal\" was \"based on excruciating life-and-death choices,\" adding that he hoped Washington would see the choices made, and the reforms undertaken to improve aid efficiency, and choose to \"renew that commitment\" to help. The world body estimates that 240 million people in conflict zones, suffering from epidemics, or victims of natural disasters and climate change are in need of emergency aid. - 'Lowest in a decade' - In 2025, the UN's appeal for more than $45 billion was only funded to the $12 billion mark -- the lowest in a decade, the world body said. That only allowed it to help 98 million people, 25 million fewer than the year before. According to UN data, the United States remains the top humanitarian aid donor in the world, but that amount fell dramatically in 2025 to $2.7 billion, down from $11 billion in 2024. Atop the list of priorities for 2026 are Gaza and the West Bank. The UN is asking for $4.1 billion for the occupied Palestinian territories, in order to provide assistance to three million people. Another country with urgent need is Sudan, where deadly conflict has displaced millions: the UN is hoping to collect $2.9 billion to help 20 million people. In Tawila, where residents of Sudan's western city of El-Fasher fled ethnically targeted violence, Fletcher said he met a young mother who saw her husband and child murdered. She fled, with the malnourished baby of her slain neighbors along what he called \"the most dangerous road in the world\" to Tawila. Men \"attacked her, raped her, broke her leg, and yet something kept her going through the horror and the brutality,\" he said. \"Does anyone, wherever you come from, whatever you believe, however you vote, not think that we should be there for her?\" The United Nations will ask member states top open their government coffers over the next 87 days -- one day for each million people who need assistance. And if the UN comes up short, Fletcher predicts it will widen the campaign, appealing to civil society, the corporate world and everyday people who he says are drowning in disinformation suggesting their tax dollars are all going abroad. \"We're asking for only just over one percent of what the world is spending on arms and defense right now,\" Fletcher said. \"I'm not asking people to choose between a hospital in Brooklyn and a hospital in Kandahar -- I'm asking the world to spend less on defense and more on humanitarian support.\" © Agence France-Presse",

In a statement issued the same day, Socheata said the incident began at 2:15 p.m. in Prolean Thmar in Choam Ksan district when Thai troops fired shotguns, B-40 machine guns and 60mm mortars. Cambodian forces did not return fire and immediately contacted the Thai side, which led to the incident ending at 2:32 p.m., she said. “During the incident, Cambodian forces refrained from retaliating and continued to cautiously monitor the situation,” the statement read. The ministry said it has notified the ASEAN Observer Team (AOT) and requested an investigation “with transparency, fairness and correctness” to determine the cause of the incident. Thai media outlet Khaosod reported that two Thai soldiers were injured in the gunfight, citing Thai military sources. Socheata reiterated Cambodia’s “unwavering commitment” to the ceasefire agreement and the Kuala Lumpur Peace Accord, saying the country remains fully aligned with peaceful dispute-resolution mechanisms to maintain long-term stability along the border. The shooting occurred as Prime Minister Hun Manet hosted visiting General Tan Sri Hj Mohd Nizam bin Hj Jaffar, Chief of Defence Forces of the Malaysian Armed Forces. During the meeting, Nizam bin Hj Jaffar reaffirmed his commitment to supporting the implementation of the Kuala Lumpur Peace Accord and the ceasefire agreement, stressing Malaysia’s neutral position.

            "content": "PHNOM PENH – With global momentum behind the landmine ban under strain, Cambodia has stepped forward once again to help steer international action, co-drafting a new UN resolution urging states to join the Ottawa Convention and strengthen support for mine victims worldwide. Prepared jointly by Japan—current president of the 22nd Meeting of States Parties—alongside Cambodia, last year’s chair, and Zambia, which will assume the presidency next year, the draft resolution was adopted by 159 UN member states on December 1, reaffirming a collective commitment to eliminating anti-personnel mines and the suffering they continue to inflict. According to Japan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the measure calls on all non-party states to accede to the Convention without delay and stresses that its impact depends on full, effective compliance. It urges governments and partners to expand victim assistance, rehabilitation and social reintegration programs, as well as intensify mine-risk education, mine-reduction efforts, and the destruction of stockpiled or newly discovered mines. The statement noted that comprehensive action is essential to address the continued threat posed by anti-personnel mines. Border Tensions Cast a Shadow Over Cambodia–Thailand Ties The renewed global push comes as landmines have resurfaced as a volatile flashpoint in the Cambodia–Thailand border dispute. Thai officials have repeatedly accused Cambodia of laying new mines in violation of the Convention—an allegation Phnom Penh dismisses as politically driven and unsupported by evidence. Tensions flared in mid-July when three Thai soldiers were injured by mine explosions along the frontier. Bangkok claimed the devices had been freshly planted by Cambodian forces, prompting sharp exchanges between the two sides. Cambodia rejected the allegations as “baseless” and called for an impartial, evidence-based investigation. Cambodian authorities, noting the country remains one of the world’s most heavily mine-affected, have urged Thailand to pursue a jointly verified inquiry or use existing bilateral mechanisms to clarify the incident. A more recent case involved a Chinese national, identified by Thai authorities as Shi Jingui, who reportedly stepped on a mine near the border. Thailand said he had crossed from Cambodia; Phnom Penh countered that no such name appears in its immigration database. Global Retreat From the Mine Ban Treaty Raises Alarm The Ottawa Convention—formally the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on Their Destruction—was adopted in 1997 and entered into force in 1999. It currently has 166 States Parties. Cambodia, which hosted the Fifth Review Conference of the Convention in Siem Reap in November 2024—the first Asian country to do so—has been a vocal advocate for universalizing the treaty and accelerating clearance of legacy minefields. But the international landscape is shifting. Major powers including the United States, Russia and China remain outside the Convention. After Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the United States supplied Kyiv with anti-personnel mines in 2024 as part of its military assistance—widely seen as contradicting the treaty’s norms. As the war dragged on, Ukraine signaled its own departure from the global ban. In June, President Volodymyr Zelensky signed a decree initiating withdrawal; the proposal is now before the Ukrainian parliament. Security anxieties in Europe have driven others to consider similar steps. In early June, the parliaments of Finland and Poland approved proposals to leave the treaty, with formal withdrawal instruments expected soon. On June 27, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania deposited their withdrawal documents with the UN; their exit will take effect six months after submission.",

He made the remark during the 22nd Meeting of States Parties to the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention, also known as the Ottawa Convention, in Geneva, Switzerland, on December 1. Acknowledging that post-war landmines still threaten border areas in several countries, Ly Thuch highlighted Cambodia’s response to these challenges by addressing the humanitarian, economic and political consequences of minefields. He said Cambodia has prioritized collaboration, dialogue and technical approaches to ensure safety along its borders. Ly Thuch also called on States Parties to uphold the norms and spirit of the Ottawa Convention, and not to exploit or take actions that contradict humanitarian principles. “States Parties should join hands to achieve the Siem Reap–Angkor Action Plan and Political Declaration to clear the past and build a peaceful future for humanity,” he said. He reaffirmed that the country’s mine action programs are conducted transparently, professionally and in full compliance with its obligations. “Such an approach can help ensure trust among States Parties, making Cambodia recognized as a leading country in mine action, information management and survivor support,” he added. Amid the gathering of international delegates, he affirmed Cambodia’s commitment to the goals of the convention and pledged to continue strengthening national capacities, supporting survivors, sharing expertise globally and helping countries affected by landmines based on their needs and requests. On the sidelines of the meeting, Ly Thuch asked International Committee of the Red Cross vice president Gilles Carbonier to press Thailand for the prompt release of 18 detained Cambodian soldiers. As of December 2, it has been 126 days since the Thai military arrested them without a warrant immediately after the ceasefire took effect on July 29. He also requested the organization to continue monitoring the wellbeing of the soldiers. In response, Carbonier pledged that the ICRC would keep working with all relevant stakeholders to ensure the soldiers’ safety and address Cambodia’s concerns. Cambodia’s Ministry of National Defense reaffirmed that the government has been working tirelessly, using all means to resolve the issue.",

            "content": "PHNOM PENH—Fresh clashes along the Cambodia–Thailand border have shattered a fragile month-long lull, pulling both armies back into a tense cycle of accusations, airstrikes, and hurried evacuations as civilians scramble once more for safety. Border gunfire resumed on December 7 in Preah Vihear province, reigniting hostilities that had simmered since the deadly confrontation in Prey Chan village last month. Each side has blamed the other for triggering the latest round of violence. Thailand said it deployed F-16 fighter jets to suppress what it described as Cambodian “supporting fire,” while Cambodia insisted it has avoided retaliation to uphold the ceasefire agreement. Lieutenant-General Maly Socheata, spokesperson for Cambodia’s Defence Ministry, said the first exchange began at 2:15 p.m. in Prolean Thmar village in Choam Ksan district, when Thai troops fired shotguns, B-40 machine guns, and 60mm mortars across the border. “Our forces did not return fire. We immediately reached out to the Thai side, and the incident ended at 2:32 p.m.,” she said. But the shooting resumed hours later. At 8:02 p.m., Socheata said Thai soldiers armed with handguns opened fire on Cambodian units in O’Pkar Sne village. She rejected claims that Cambodian troops had responded with force. “They used false accusations as a pretext to escalate tension,” she said, adding that Thai forces launched a third assault at 8:30 p.m. with handguns and mortars toward Cambodian positions in Prolean Thmar before the attack ended at 8:50 p.m. Thai media reported a sharply different version of events. Major-General Winthai Suvaree, spokesperson for the Royal Thai Army, said Cambodian troops fired first on Thai forces in the Phu Pha Lek–Phlarn Hin Paed Kon area in Si Saket province, injuring two Thai soldiers. “Our units were carrying out road maintenance at the time,” Winthai said. “Cambodia claims it didn’t fire, but we have recorded evidence, including time and location, that supports our account.” Later that evening, Thailand’s Second Army Region reported movements of Cambodian T-55 tanks in Krong Samraong, Oddar Meanchey province, and said it had detected RM-70 multiple rocket launchers in Choam Ksan district. Socheata dismissed the report as misinformation. She said Cambodia had not deployed “heavy or destructive weapons” along the border and had taken no action that violated the ceasefire or the Kuala Lumpur Peace Accord. Pre-dawn Gunfire and Confirmation of F-16 strikes Fighting intensified early on December 8. Socheata said Thai forces opened fire at 5:04 a.m. on Cambodian units in the An Ses area of Preah Vihear province. She said the attack escalated quickly, with Thai troops firing multiple rounds — including tank shells — toward Tamoan Thom temple and the 5 Makara zone near Preah Vihear Temple. Gunfire was also reported in the Chomka Chek area. Winthai later confirmed that Thailand deployed F-16 fighter jets to strike Cambodian artillery positions in response to what he described as an attack on the Anupong base. He said one Thai soldier was killed and two were wounded. The initial airstrike targets, he said, were Chong An Ma, Prasat Khana, and a radio tower near Preah Vihear Temple. Thai Air Force spokesperson Chakkris Thammavichai said the operation was carried out with Suranaree units “to neutralize Cambodian military actions that posed a direct threat to Thailand’s security and the safety of civilians, including personnel in the border area.” At 8:30 a.m., Thailand’s Second Army Region said Cambodian forces fired BM-21 rockets at Thai civilian areas in Ban Sai Tho 10 in Ban Kruat district, Buri Ram province. Civilians Flee Again as Schools Close Residents on both sides of the border have been forced to flee in repeated waves. Thai authorities said around 70 people in four border provinces were evacuated. In Cambodia, families in Samraong city and nearby villages in Oddar Meanchey and Preah Vihear left their homes again as the fighting spread. Local authorities reported that three Cambodian civilians were injured during the evacuations, and several houses were burned down by shelling as residents rushed to escape the attack. Cambodian students also fled their classrooms on the morning of December 8. The Ministry of Education ordered temporary school closures in Oddar Meanchey to protect students and teachers. Thai media reported that the Ministry of Education has closed 641 schools in five provinces along the Thai-Cambodian border for the safety of teachers and students. Last month, on November 12, fighting in contested Prey Chan village in Banteay Meanchey province injured five Cambodian civilians and drew widespread media attention — a stark reminder of how quickly this border dispute can ignite.",

This intricate process, governed by a complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors, is a testament to the awe-inspiring complexity of life. As we delve into the world of embryology, we find ourselves navigating a labyrinth of cellular differentiation, morphogenesis, and pattern formation, all orchestrated by an exquisite ballet of molecular interactions. The journey begins with fertilization, where a spermatozoon, propelled by its motile flagellum, fuses with an oocyte, releasing a cascade of biochemical signals that initiate the developmental program. This pivotal event triggers a series of cleavages, during which the zygote undergoes a rapid sequence of cell divisions, culminating in the formation of a blastocyst, a hollow sphere of cells comprising the inner cell mass and the trophoblast. The inner cell mass, destined to give rise to the embryo proper, undergoes gastrulation, a critical phase of development where the three primary germ layers – ectoderm, endoderm, and mesoderm – emerge, paving the way for the formation of tissues and organs. As the embryo develops, it undergoes a series of morphogenetic movements, including invagination, evagination, and migration, which shape the body plan and establish the basic architecture of the organism. The neural tube, formed through the folding of the ectoderm, gives rise to the central nervous system, while the mesoderm differentiates into muscle, bone, and connective tissue. Meanwhile, the endoderm lining the archenteron, the primitive gut, will eventually form the epithelial lining of the digestive tract, respiratory system, and other associated organs. Pattern formation, a crucial aspect of embryonic development, is mediated by a complex interplay of signaling pathways, including the Wnt/β-catenin, Notch, and BMP pathways, which orchestrate the spatial organization of cells and tissues. These pathways, regulated by a delicate balance of transcription factors, growth factors, and extracellular matrix components, ensure the precise specification of cell fate and the emergence of functional structures. The remarkable precision of this process is evident in the formation of the vertebrate limb, where a harmonious interplay of Hox genes, FGFs, and BMPs guides the development of skeletal elements, muscles, and nerves. Throughout this journey, the embryo is shaped by an intricate dialogue between genetic and environmental factors. Epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation and histone acetylation, play a critical role in regulating gene expression, while maternal and paternal effects, transmitted through the gametes, influence the developmental trajectory. The embryonic environment, comprising the womb, placenta, and amniotic fluid, provides essential nutrients, hormones, and mechanical cues that guide growth and patterning. In conclusion, embryology offers a fascinating glimpse into the intricate mechanisms governing the emergence of life. Through the lens of developmental biology, we gain insight into the majestic complexity of creation, where genetic and environmental factors converge to shape the wondrous diversity of organisms on our planet. As we continue to unravel the secrets of embryonic development, we are reminded of the profound beauty and mystery of life itself, a testament to the awe-inspiring power of science to illuminate the human experience.",

            "content": "PHNOM PENH – Unilateral investigations of landmine explosions without bilateral consultation erode Article 8 of the Ottawa Convention and undermine trust among State Parties, Cambodian Ambassador In Dara has told the UN. This was politicizing the narrative away from being a humanitarian matter. Under the topic “Preventing and Suppressing Prohibited Activities and Facilitating Compliance”, In Dara, Permanent Representative of Cambodia to the United Nations Office in Geneva, spoke at the Meeting of the States Parties to the Ottawa Convention on Dec. 4 in Geneva. The ambassador raised allegations by Thailand against Cambodia about “newly emplaced mines”. He said incidents occurred on Cambodian territory, based on maps produced under the 1904 and 1907 Treaties and reaffirmed in the 2000 memorandum of understanding. “Thailand's so-called evidence is entirely unilateral, produced without permitting Cambodia or neutral experts accessing to the sites,” Dara said. “Such opacity falls far below any standard of scientific credibility or good-faith cooperation. Claims that cannot withstand independent scrutiny cannot credibly form the basis of a compliance allegation under this Convention.” The ambassador said this was not a narrative competition, but a matter of method. Cambodia wanted the transparency and shared investigation to seek the truth in humanitarian disarmament, not from unilateral assertion. “Compliance assessments under this Convention must be guided by verifiable evidence, objective analysis and cooperative verification,” Dara said. Cambodia considered the Ottawa Convention not only a treaty of prohibitions but also a collective ethical compact. “It affirms that the remnants of war must not be permitted to outlast the conflicts that produced them and that weapons incapable of distinguishing between combatant and civilian have no place in any rules-based international order,” Dara said. These principles are the lived realities for Cambodia, a country that has been hurt economically and socially by landmines and remnants of war. The country adhered to the Convention due to its experience, moral conviction and the understanding of humanitarian law’s role in protecting people. It was not an instrument of political convenience. The ambassador expressed concern over Thailand’s persistent attempts to politicize the Convention’s compliance mechanisms to advance extraneous political and territorial aims. This was the opposite of the mechanisms’ duty to safeguard the Convention, not as leverage in disputes or strategic messaging. “No state party should permit such distortion,” Dara said. In responding to the landmine accusation, Cambodia has provided clarity and evidence with technical detail, historical context and precise geographical data, which were in a comprehensive clarification document submitted to the UN Secretary-General. “This reaffirms our unbroken record as a principled, constructive and cooperative State Party,” he said. The ambassador said politicizing such a matter erodes the integrity of Article 8, which undermines the mutual trust among State Parties and risks transforming a humanitarian regime into a forum for strategic manipulation. “If left unchecked, it would weaken the Convention for all States Parties, compromising its impartiality, legitimacy and humanitarian character,” Dara said. Article 8, the ambassador continued, was to foster trust, not suspicion, and to require cooperation, not confrontation. It was not a shortcut for unilateral accusation or political maneuvering. According to Article 8(1), States Parties “agree to consult and cooperate with each other regarding the implementation of the provisions of this Convention, and to work together in a spirit of cooperation to facilitate compliance by States Parties with their obligations under this Convention.” Meanwhile, article 8(2) says, “If one or more States Parties wish to clarify and seek to resolve questions relating to compliance with the provisions of this Convention by another State Party, it may submit, through the Secretary-General of the United Nations, a Request for Clarification of that matter to that State Party. Such a request shall be accompanied by all appropriate information. “Each State Party shall refrain from unfounded requests for clarification, care being taken to avoid abuse. A State Party that receives a request for clarification shall provide, through the Secretary-General of the United Nations, within 28 days to the requesting State Party all information which would assist in clarifying this matter.” The ambassador said, “Thailand's invocation of Article 8(2) without discharging its obligations under Article 8(1) first constitutes a deliberate instrumentalization of the Convention's compliance tools for purposes wholly unrelated to mine action.” Such an inversion departs from the Convention’s legal sequence and replaces fact-based inquiry with adversarial positioning. The ambassador called out Thailand for abusing the process. “Cambodia rejects such misuse,” Dara said. “Humanitarian disarmament is sustained not by political expediency but by principled conduct.” The ambassador recalled that the Convention authority depends on the integrity of its processes, the accuracy of its evidence and the good-faith conduct of its States Parties. Cambodia, with the history of suffering from landmines and legal responsibilities, wants no community to endure such misery. The ambassador urged all State Parties to “defend the Convention against politicization, uphold the procedural and evidentiary integrity of Article 8, and ensure that compliance deliberations remain firmly grounded in truth, cooperation and the humanitarian purpose that inspired this treaty.” Cambodia reaffirmed its readiness to engage constructively, transparently, and accordingly with the principles in the Convention.",

Yes, it's quite expensive compared to local food, and that's why i wonder what are the benefits to go eat there for a westerner, except for the nostalgia thing if living since long enough abroad (assuming being a long time consumer of the brand). On the other hand, local fastfoods like Lucky Burger in Kow are indeed worse than Mc D. So, a bit expensive, top of the industrial burger segment, not very good, not very healthy, coming to challenge BK. For the 50cts beer, well that is the bottom of the beer barrel but when an abroad alcoholic, budget is the real issue, health comes after. I didn't enjoyed much the Khmer food, but coming from Indonesia before that, i was amazed by the large choice of foreign food available, in restaurants or supermarkets, and the cheap pricing of alcohol (i didn't drink much, like 2 or 3 beers a week, even less nowadays).

Perfect for a quick breakfast before an early meeting or flight out. I think their Thailand restaurants are well-run; hopefully the same can be accomplished in Cambodia. What I'd like to see are 24/7 standalone restaurants at Phnom Penh's Riverside and Siem Reap's Pub Street locations, as well as at the international airports. I'm not interested in seeing them pop up at shopping malls, but I'm sure that will happen anyway, for other hungry people with different preferences.

During the working meeting, the Deputy Prime Minister highlighted the attractiveness of the Cambodian market, detailing in depth the factors that make Cambodia a potential investment destination for global food franchise businesses. The potential for investment in Cambodia is driven by the rapid growth of the urban population and the large number of young people with rising average incomes and embracing global food culture, as well as a favourable business environment with government support for the import of well-known brands.

Kroc's first contact with the company was when he sold them milkshake machines as a salesman. I hope that McDonald's expands into Cambodia.

If you use some brands of VPN I guess they are slowed down . I'd assume if they advertise in Cambodia or someone here benefits from them they are not slowed too much. If I stay with in the Cambodian Internet I get over 100mbps. Switch to a VPN it's dial up speed. I don't have the link to the secret VPN that some of your talking about. My paid TV from expat TV that uses NORD is getting 71.24 maps today as compared to 131mbps on the Cambodian network. But expat TV some days is unusable or too slow to watch. Then they do something and it comes back. I'm not sure I can use it's connection to play the regular TV and the free channels LG offers to everyone except if your in Cambodia . It goes through a fire stick. And is plug into one of the input ports. This is all too confusing I'm sure it Cambodia trying to force you to use there inferior TV program providers and and stifle competition even if it is the better product.

VIDEO I get what you’re saying, but McDonald’s in Thailand or Vietnam isn’t exactly cheap compared to the local food. Even for western food, like burgers, the locally made options are cheaper and better than anything at McDonald’s. Yes, it's quite expensive compared to local food, and that's why i wonder what are the benefits to go eat there for a westerner, except for the nostalgia thing if living since long enough abroad (assuming being a long time consumer of the brand). On the other hand, local fastfoods like Lucky Burger in Kow are indeed worse than Mc D. So, a bit expensive, top of the industrial burger segment, not very good, not very healthy, coming to challenge BK. For the 50cts beer, well that is the bottom of the beer barrel but when an abroad alcoholic, budget is the real issue, health comes after. I didn't enjoyed much the Khmer food, but coming from Indonesia before that, i was amazed by the large choice of foreign food available, in restaurants or supermarkets, and the cheap pricing of alcohol (i didn't drink much, like 2 or 3 beers a week, even less nowadays). I was also surprised by the drunk and drugs demographics, but then coming from a mostly muslim country, it wasn't so exposed for all to see.",

The VPN was super fast before now unusable. I tried a other free one just as slow. I think this VPN thing is going to be obsolete soon because most companies we sites youtube know you're using it and they won't allow you to log in or tell you to turn it off. It's almost impossible to log in to play station website on a VPN. The games available to download are not the same if Cambodia is your address. VPN to usa used to fix this.

But now That not how it works. They can’t control your traffic once you are inside the VPN. they can limit your connection to said VPN. I am using a private VPN I setup running on AWS server in US and it’s working fine. The only issue you will have is with publicly known VPN providers. If you setup something private or connects to a company in USA or elsewhere they can’t block it unless they know the specific IP address. I don’t think they have the resources for it.

            "content": "New Delhi [India], December 5 (ANI): Congress leader Pawan Khera questioned the decision to invite party MP Shashi Tharoor to the President's banquet hosted in honour of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who is on a state visit to India. Speaking to ANI, Khera said he was 'quite surprised', especially as key Congress leaders were not included in the guest list. 'It's quite surprising that an invitation was sent...Jinhone invite kiya unhone kamaal kiya, jinne invitation liya vo bhi kamaal kar rahe hai (Those who sent the invitation have done something remarkable, and those who accepted it are also doing something remarkable),' Khera said. Taking a dig at the BJP government, Khera added, 'Everyone's conscience has a voice. When my leaders aren't invited, but I am, we should understand why the game is being played, who is playing the game, and why we shouldn't be part of it.' Khera's remarks come as Shashi Tharoor today confirmed that he has received an invitation to the state banquet at Rashtrapati Bhavan, hosted in honour of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who is on a two-day visit to India. 'Yes, I have got the invitation. I certainly should be going,' Tharoor told the reporters outside the Parliament. On Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge and Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi not being invited to the high-profile dinner, he said, 'I don't know about the Leader of the Opposition not being invited, and I am not aware of the basis on which invitations were issued...I am honoured to be invited.' Earlier, Rahul Gandhi alleged that the Centre advises foreign dignitaries not to meet the LoP, calling it a violation of long-standing parliamentary tradition and a reflection of the government's 'insecurity.' 'This has been a tradition. But these days, foreign dignitaries visit, or when I visit abroad, the government suggests that they not meet the LoP. This is their policy, and they do it all the time,' Rahul Gandhi said while speaking to reporters outside Parliament. 'We have relations with everyone. LoP gives a different perspective. We too represent India. It is not just the government which does it. The government doesn't want the Opposition meeting people from outside. Modi ji and the Foreign Ministry don't follow this norm. It is their insecurity,' he added. Government sources refuted Gandhi's claims, clarifying that it is the visiting delegation, not the Modi government, that decides whom to meet outside official programmes. 'During a visit, MEA organises meetings for the incoming dignitary with Government officials and Government bodies. It is up to the visiting delegation to organise meetings outside the government,' the sources said. They also noted that several foreign leaders have met the LoP since June 2024, including former Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina (June 10, 2024), Vietnam PM Pham Minh Chinh (August 1, 2024), Malaysian PM Anwar Ibrahim (August 21, 2024), Mauritius PM Navinchandra Ramgoolam (September 16, 2025), and New Zealand PM Christopher Luxon (March 8, 2025).

            "content": "Colombo [Sri Lanka], December 5 (ANI): The abrupt shutdown of Foxconn's Henyang Hong Fujin Precision Industry facility on September 30, 2025, has sent tremors through central China's industrial heartland. Once home to 30,000 workers and a major contributor to the regional economy, the now-abandoned complex reflects a deeper malaise in China's manufacturing sector, a crisis rooted in corruption, erratic governance, and dwindling investor confidence, as reported by Daily Mirror Online. According to Daily Mirror Online, for decades, China thrived as the 'world's factory,' attracting multinational giants like Foxconn with cheap labour and state-backed infrastructure. The company, Apple's largest supplier, once accounted for over 80 per cent of Zhengzhou's exports and half of Henan's total. But when Foxconn began relocating operations to Vietnam and India, local economies plunged. Henan's mobile phone exports dropped by 60 per cent in early 2024, while the province's overall trade shrank by nearly a quarter. Formerly bustling factory towns now resemble ghost cities, as displaced workers struggle with unstable gig jobs. While some analysts attribute Foxconn's retreat to slowing global demand, China's own policy failures as the core cause. Years of arbitrary regulations, rising costs, and the chilling effects of the US-China trade war drove companies toward more stable markets. Apple's growing distrust of China's tightening controls only accelerated this exodus. Nations like Vietnam and India, offering transparency and policy consistency, have emerged as safer manufacturing hubs, as cited by Daily Mirror Online. The fallout has been devastating for Chinese workers. Foxconn, despite its controversial labour record, was considered reliable compared to smaller 'black factories' that now dominate workplaces notorious for wage theft, unsafe conditions, and exploitation. Corruption and weak regulation have allowed such abuses to flourish unchecked. As multinational firms continue to withdraw, the once-glittering promise of China's economic miracle fades. The CCP's obsession with control and its inability to reform a decaying governance model have left millions without security or hope, as reported by Daily Mirror Online. (ANI)",

'No one from IndiGo is providing any answers. We have been standing here since morning... I have been standing here since morning. I have to reach Bengaluru urgently by evening... I am worried,' he said. In another incident, a passenger at the Biju Patnaik International Airport, Odisha, shared her ordeal, stating that even after spending three hours at the airport, she was not given any clarifications on her flight status.

The order said, 'It is expected: All flight schedules would stabilise and begin returning to normal midnight tonight; Full services and stability should return over the next couple of days; Passengers can track delays, if any, from home through information system installed by IndiGo and others; In the event of flight cancellation IndiGo will ensure automatic full refund for tickets.'

Special measures have been taken to ensure senior citizens are not discomfited in any manner. They will be provided with lounge access; Passengers of delayed flights will be provided with refreshments and other necessities; A 24x7 control room at the Ministry of Civil Aviation is constantly monitoring the situation on a time basis,' the order further read. The Ministry of Civil Aviation said that the Central Government is fully alert to the woes of air passengers and is in constant consultation with all stakeholders. 'Every possible measure, including rule exemptions as announced by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation on Friday, will be taken to restore schedules and ensure stability to mitigate the public's woes,' the statement added.

            "content": "Abuja [Nigeria] December 5 (ANI): Africa is fast emerging as the new battleground in a sweeping wave of cybercrime, with Nigeria at its centre, exposing the growing reach of China-linked digital fraud syndicates across the continent. Large-scale raids in Lagos and Abuja between late 2024 and early 2025 uncovered extensive online scam operations run with corporate precision. Nearly 1,000 individuals, including 177 Chinese nationals, were arrested in what authorities described as one of Nigeria's most complex cybercrime investigations to date, as reported by Capital News. According to Capital News, these were not small-time fraud cells but sophisticated setups resembling professional offices equipped with computers, thousands of SIM cards and structured training units. Nigerian recruits were reportedly trained in phishing, cryptocurrency scams and digital deception under the direction of foreign masterminds. The findings revealed that Africa's cybercrime landscape has shifted from isolated actors to well-organised, transnational networks. Nigeria's Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has vowed to dismantle such syndicates, but the magnitude of their operations indicates deep cooperation between local accomplices and foreign crime networks. These criminal groups, many previously active in Southeast Asia, have increasingly migrated to Africa as regional law enforcement tightened in countries like Cambodia and Myanmar. Similar incidents have been reported elsewhere on the continent. In 2024, Zambia broke up a massive fraud syndicate involving 22 Chinese nationals; Angola arrested dozens tied to digital gambling scams; and Namibia exposed a major cryptocurrency fraud operation linked to Chinese suspects. These arrests highlight Africa's growing role as a preferred base for global cybercriminal networks, as highlighted by Capital News. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) revealed that syndicates originating from China and Southeast Asia have been draining billions through fake investments and cryptocurrency schemes. Interpol's Africa Cyberthreat Assessment 2025 warned that such groups increasingly use AI-driven tools, malware and encrypted financial channels, posing grave threats to national security. Africa's dependence on Chinese economic ties complicates law enforcement efforts. Without stronger cyber laws and international cooperation, analysts warn, the continent risks becoming the next stronghold of China-linked digital exploitation, as reported by Capital News. (ANI)",

            "content": "New Delhi [India], December 5 (ANI): India's aviation sector is witnessing a historic fiasco of flight disruptions, with IndiGo cancelling all domestic flights departing from Delhi Airport and acknowledging that today was the most severely affected, with over 1,000 cancellations. Even as the Civil Aviation Ministry's priority remains to restore normalcy, IndiGo CEO Peter Elbers categorically stated that things are expected to return to normal between December 10 and 15. 'December 5 was the most severely impacted day, with the number of cancellations well over 1000. I extend our sincerest apologies for the inconvenience it has caused to our customers. It will take some time to return to a full normal situation, which we do anticipate between 10-15 December,' Elbers said in a video message. IndiGo requested passengers to note that earlier in the day, its flights from Kempegowda International Airport Bengaluru (BLR Airport) to Mumbai and Delhi were also cancelled until 23:59 hours on December 5. The discontent among passengers stranded at airports across the country is increasing by the second, with heated arguments with airline authorities becoming a common sight. A spat broke out between stranded passengers and staff at the Mumbai airport amid the ongoing IndiGo's nationwide flight disruption. As this happened, Civil Aviation Minister Ram Mohan Naidu held IndiGo's mismanagement regarding its crew, with respect to the new flight duty time limitation (FDTL) regulations issued by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), responsible for the disruption of its operations, leading to severe delays and congestion at the major airports across the country. Speaking to ANI, the Minister said the events that have unfolded in major airports led the Civil Aviation Ministry to grant IndiGo a certain abeyance from FDTL norms to ensure normalcy and aid stranded passengers. 'From November 1, the DGCA came up with new FDTL (flight duty time limitation) regulations. The Ministry also initiated a continuous engagement process with the airlines for at least 6 months. Previously, there was no issue regarding the new FDTL norm. Other airlines, including Air India and Spice Jet, have adjusted. However, what has unfolded is due to mismanagement by IndiGo regarding its crew. We have given certain abeyance regarding FDTL norms to IndiGo to ensure normalcy,' Naidu said. IndiGo CEO Elbers said the FDTL implementation relief was a great help in ensuring normalcy returns. 'We are truly sorry, and we will take care,' IndiGo said in a statement. Naidu, however, said a committee has been formed to look into the disruption and inquire where things went wrong. Whoever is responsible for the present situation needs to pay for it, he added. 'Since we have observed this only with IndiGo, we have formed a committee which will inquire into all this so that they can establish where things went wrong and who did it wrong. We will take the necessary action on that as well. This thing shouldn't be left unattended. We are taking strict action on this, so that whoever was responsible for this needs to pay for it,' Naidu said. IndiGo's dominant market share of almost 70 per cent has raised concerns about a monopoly. The recent cancellation of over 500 flights has stranded thousands of passengers, sparking outrage in Parliament. The DGCA has attributed the disruptions to IndiGo's 'misjudgment and gap in planning' in implementing new pilot duty-hour regulations. The centre has directed airlines to implement measures to resolve the disruptions and ensure passenger refunds. IndiGo has been granted a one-time exemption from the DGCA's pilot night duty rules until February 10, 2026. This exemption allows IndiGo to bypass stricter flight duty and rest period norms, specifically those related to night duty between 0000 and 0650 hours and to night operations. The DGCA has also withdrawn the rule that restricted airlines from counting pilot leave as weekly rest. The exemption is aimed at stabilising IndiGo's operations and reducing passenger disruptions caused by the airline's pilot staffing crunch. However, the Airlines' Pilots Association (ALPA) of India has criticised the decision, arguing that it sets a dangerous precedent and undermines established safety regulations. In Odisha's Bhubaneswar, a passenger travelling with a differently-abled child and a senior citizen said that IndiGo's customer care was unreachable, while fares with other airlines had increased. 'We are travelling with a differently abled kid and a senior citizen. The IndiGo customer care number is not working. The prices of other flight tickets have increased. If tickets have to be cancelled, they are showing non-refundable,' he said. A large number of passengers faced inconvenience across the country, as IndiGo flights faced delays and cancellations. Amid the ongoing issue, a passenger scheduled to reach Bengaluru from Jodhpur Airport shared that the airline has been unresponsive since morning. 'No one from IndiGo is providing any answers. We have been standing here since morning. I have been standing here since morning. I have to reach Bengaluru urgently by evening. I am worried,' he said. In another incident, a passenger at the Biju Patnaik International Airport in Odisha shared her ordeal, stating that, even after spending three hours at the airport, she was not given any clarification on her flight status. 'My flight from Bhubaneswar to Bengaluru was scheduled for December 5. I had a flight to Vietnam from Bengaluru. This crisis began on December 3.

The Royal Thai Army said clashes first erupted on Sunday and accused Cambodian troops of opening fire at Thai soldiers in eastern Ubon Ratchathani province. One Thai soldier was killed and four others were wounded, after which additional Thai soldiers were attacked with artillery and drones at Anupong Base, the army said. Royal Thai Air Force spokesman Air Marshal Jackkrit Thammavichai announced later on Monday that F-16 fighter jets were deployed to \"reduce Cambodia's military capabilities to the minimum level necessary to safeguard national security and protect civilians.\" Cambodian Defense Ministry spokeswoman Lieutenant General Maly Socheata said late on Sunday that Thai troops carried out several attacks on Cambodian positions using small arms, mortars, and tanks. \"The Thai side also falsely accused Cambodia without any basis, despite the fact that Cambodian forces did not retaliate at all,\" she said. The ministry also denied Thai claims of a military buildup along the border. The border dispute dates back to colonial times, when France, which ruled Cambodia until 1953, mapped the lines between the two countries. The July conflict killed dozens of people and displaced more than 200,000 on both sides.",

'Deliberately excluding the Opposition from such interactions weakens India's institutional credibility and turns foreign affairs into yet another partisan battleground,' he added.

According to the Royal Thai Army, Cambodian forces fired shells and rockets at Thai military and civilian areas around 7 am in the Chong Bok area of Nam Yuen district. One Thai soldier was killed, and four others were injured in the attack. Maj Gen Winthai Suvaree said Thai troops returned fire and later used fighter jets to strike Cambodian locations to halt the incoming attacks, Bangkok Post reported. 'The target was at Cambodia's arms supporting positions in the area of Chong An Ma Pass, because those targets had used artillery and mortar launchers to attack the Thai side at Anupong Base,' he added as per CNN. The 2nd Army Region also reported that around 8.30 am, rockets fired from Cambodian BM-21 launchers hit Ban Sai Tho 10 in Ban Kruat district of Buri Ram province. Cambodia, meanwhile, accused Thailand of initiating Monday's violence. 'It should be noted that this attack occurred after the Thai forces engaged in numerous provocative actions for many days,' the Cambodian army said, claiming Thai forces struck first at around 5.04 am. Cambodia's Ministry of National Defence accused Thai military forces of launching 'brutal and inhumane' attacks on Cambodian troops along the border in Preah Vihear province, calling the incident a serious violation of the peace agreement signed during the ASEAN summit in Kuala Lumpur. The fresh clashes come only weeks after Thailand suspended a peace agreement signed in Kuala Lumpur in late October. The pact, witnessed by US President Donald Trump, was presented as a major diplomatic breakthrough. Thailand paused its commitments to the agreement in November after a landmine blast injured two of its soldiers. The latest escalation also follows Trump's recent comments in Washington, where he claimed to have settled 8 wars in 10 months because of the rights clearly given to the president of the United States.' Cambodia and Thailand were among them. Border tensions between Thailand and Cambodia stretch back decades, rooted in disputes over colonial-era maps. The frontier has seen repeated clashes, most recently in July, when fighting involving jets, missiles and ground troops killed dozens and displaced nearly 200,000 people. (ANI)",

The 33-page National Security Strategy document, signed by Donald Trump, repeated the claim that the US president brokered peace between India and Pakistan, a claim India disputes. Trump has repeatedly claimed to have mediated peace between India and Pakistan, despite India's denial of third-party involvement. The report dubbed Trump as 'President of Peace' for negotiating conflicts and achieving unprecedented peace in eight conflicts worldwide, including the peace deal between Pakistan and India. The US President has claimed credit for bringing India and Pakistan back from 'nuclear conflict' by mediating the May 10 ceasefire agreement. 'He negotiated peace between Cambodia and Thailand, Kosovo and Serbia, the DRC and Rwanda, Pakistan and India, Israel and Iran, Egypt and Ethiopia, Armenia and Azerbaijan, and ended the war in Gaza with all living hostages returned to their families,' the report read. The document highlights India's role in Indo-Pacific security and mentions the Quad, marking a shift from US isolationism. The strategy emphasises improving commercial relations with India to encourage New Delhi's contribution to Indo-Pacific security through quadrilateral cooperation with Australia, Japan, and the US. 'We must continue to improve commercial (and other) relations with India to encourage New Delhi to contribute to Indo-Pacific security, including through continued quadrilateral cooperation with Australia, Japan, and the United States ('the Quad'). Moreover, we will also work to align the actions of our allies and partners with our joint interest in preventing domination by any single competitor nation,' the report said. The approach focuses on managed cooperation, strategic alignment, and long-term US investment to promote growth and security. Key areas of collaboration include AI, quantum computing, and autonomous systems. 'The United States must at the same time invest in research to preserve and advance our advantage in cutting-edge military and dual-use technology, with emphasis on the domains where US advantages are strongest. These include undersea, space, and nuclear, as well as others that will decide the future of military power, such as AI, quantum computing, and autonomous systems, plus the energy necessary to fuel these domains,' as per the report. The strategy also highlights the importance of aligning allies' actions with joint interests, investing in research to preserve US advantages in cutting-edge technology, and enlisting European and Asian allies, including India, to cement joint positions. 'America should similarly enlist our European and Asian allies and partners, including India, to cement and improve our joint positions in the Western Hemisphere and, with regard to critical minerals, in Africa. We should form coalitions that use our comparative advantages in finance and technology to build export markets with cooperating countries. America's economic partners should no longer expect to earn income from the United States through overcapacity and structural imbalances but instead pursue growth through managed cooperation tied to strategic alignment and by receiving long-term US investment,' the report said.

            "content": "Ahmedabad (Gujarat) [India], December 6 (ANI): Long queues, passengers in tears, and repeated flight cancellations created a morning of severe disruption at Ahmedabad's Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport on Saturday, as IndiGo continued to face nationwide operational delays. The disruptions came even as the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) placed its Flight Duty Time Limitations (FDTL) orders in abeyance with immediate effect. The regulatory pause follows days of nationwide delays and cancellations affecting IndiGo's flight operations, causing widespread inconvenience to passengers across sectors. At Ahmedabad airport alone, between 12 am and 6 am on Saturday, seven arrivals and twelve departures were cancelled, airport officials said. The halt in services triggered long waiting lines, crowding at counters, and growing frustration among passengers unable to find alternate travel options. Among those impacted was Mahrishi Jani, who broke down while explaining how the disruption cost him and his team an opportunity they had worked towards for months. 'I was scheduled to go to Guwahati on a 6.15 am flight; this was a connecting flight from Kolkata. We were selected for Smart India Hackathon 2025; about 74,000 ideas were submitted there, and nearly 1400 ideas were selected. Our centre was North-Eastern Hill University, and we were scheduled to perform there,' he told ANI. Jani added that despite months of preparation, the cancellation left his six-member team and two accompanying mentors with no viable alternative. 'We had booked IndiGo flights. But the flight is delayed and so, we will not be able to go there. There is no other possible way of transportation. If we take a train, it will take us 3 days to reach there. Our hard work of 6-7 months is now wasted. We are returning home. Such opportunities are rare...We were selected in the first attempt, but due to flight cancellation, we are unable to go ahead. We were a team of 6 people, and we were accompanied by 2 mentors.' Another passenger, Ikhlaq Hussain, described being stranded despite travelling internationally. 'I have reached Ahmedabad from Jeddah, and I am scheduled to head to Lucknow...I am stuck here for the past 2 days but the flight keeps getting delayed,' Hussain said. On Friday, a large number of passengers faced inconvenience across the country as IndiGo flights experienced delays and cancellations. Amid the ongoing issue, a passenger who was scheduled to reach Bengaluru from the Jodhpur Airport shared that the airline has been unresponsive since morning. 'No one from IndiGo is providing any answers. We have been standing here since morning... I have been standing here since morning. I have to reach Bengaluru urgently by evening... I am worried,' he said. Additionally, another, a passenger at the Biju Patnaik International Airport, Odisha, shared her ordeal, stating that even after spending three hours at the airport, she was not given any clarifications on her flight status. 'My flight from Bhubaneswar to Bengaluru was scheduled for December 5... I had a flight to Vietnam from Bengaluru. This crisis began on December 3. I reached here yesterday to ask about my flight schedule...I spent three hours here asking them about my flight status, but they said they don't know... Yesterday, they had flights to Bengaluru...I requested them to accommodate me in one of their flights scheduled for Bengaluru so that I could catch my international flight to Vietnam from here... but they did not accommodate even one seat for me... We did not have the option to travel by road because the distance between Bhubaneswar and Bengaluru takes 25-26 hours to cover... No one is listening to anything. There is just one staff member, and they have no answers or solutions... There is no clarity...' she stated. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Civil Aviation has directed airlines, especially IndiGo, to implement measures immediately to resolve the severe disruption to flight schedules and stabilise services without delay, an official statement said. Two orders have been issued to address problems faced by the public and restore service stability, especially on IndiGo. The order said, 'It is expected: All flight schedules would stabilise and begin returning to normal midnight tonight; Full services and stability should return over the next couple of days; Passengers can track delays, if any, from home through information system installed by IndiGo and others; In the event of flight cancellation IndiGo will ensure automatic full refund for tickets.' 'If passengers are stranded, they will be put up at hotels where accommodation has been booked by airlines. Special measures have been taken to ensure senior citizens are not discomfited in any manner. They will be provided with lounge access; Passengers of delayed flights will be provided with refreshments and other necessities; A 24x7 control room at the Ministry of Civil Aviation is constantly monitoring the situation on a time basis,' the order further read. The Ministry of Civil Aviation said that the Central Government is fully alert to the woes of air passengers and is in constant consultation with all stakeholders. 'Every possible measure, including rule exemptions as announced by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation on Friday, will be taken to restore schedules and ensure stability to mitigate the public's woes,' the statement added.

In a post shared on X, Congress leader said, 'There has been speculation whether the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha and the Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha have been invited for tonight's official dinner in honour of President Putin. The two LoPs have not been invited.' https://x.com/Jairam_Ramesh/status/1996927273484902802 Earlier today, Congress leader Pawan Khera questioned the decision to invite party MP Shashi Tharoor to the President's banquet hosted in honour of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who is on a state visit to India. Speaking to ANI, Khera said he was 'quite surprised', especially as key Congress leaders were not included in the guest list. 'It's quite surprising that an invitation was sent...Jinhone invite kiya unhone kamaal kiya, jinne invitation liya vo bhi kamaal kar rahe hai (Those who sent the invitation have done something remarkable, and those who accepted it are also doing something remarkable),' Khera said. Taking a dig at the BJP government, Khera added, 'Everyone's conscience has a voice. When my leaders aren't invited, but I am, we should understand why the game is being played, who is playing the game, and why we shouldn't be part of it.' Khera's remarks come as Shashi Tharoor today confirmed that he has received an invitation to the state banquet at Rashtrapati Bhavan, hosted in honour of Russian President Vladimir Putin. 'Yes, I have got the invitation. I certainly should be going,' Tharoor told the reporters outside the Parliament. On Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge and Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi not being invited to the high-profile dinner, he said, 'I don't know about the Leader of the Opposition not being invited, and I am not aware of the basis on which invitations were issued...I am honoured to be invited.' Earlier, Rahul Gandhi alleged that the Centre advises foreign dignitaries not to meet the LoP, calling it a violation of long-standing parliamentary tradition and a reflection of the government's 'insecurity.' 'This has been a tradition. But these days, foreign dignitaries visit, or when I visit abroad, the government suggests that they not meet the LoP. This is their policy, and they do it all the time,' Gandhi said while speaking to reporters outside Parliament. 'We have relations with everyone. LoP gives a different perspective. We too represent India. It is not just the government which does it. The government doesn't want the Opposition meeting people from outside. Modi ji and the Foreign Ministry don't follow this norm. It is their insecurity,' he added. Government sources refuted Gandhi's claims, clarifying that it is the visiting delegation, not the Modi government, that decides whom to meet outside official programmes. 'During a visit, MEA organises meetings for the incoming dignitary with Government officials and Government bodies. It is up to the visiting delegation to organise meetings outside the government,' the sources said. They also noted that several foreign leaders have met the LoP since June 2024, including former Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina (June 10, 2024), Vietnam PM Pham Minh Chinh (August 1, 2024), Malaysian PM Anwar Ibrahim (August 21, 2024), Mauritius PM Navinchandra Ramgoolam (September 16, 2025), and New Zealand PM Christopher Luxon (March 8, 2025).

            "content": "Hydroelectric Power: A Deep Dive into the Mechanics of Hydro Energy Deep within the heart of our planet, a force so profound and yet so elegantly simple has been harnessed by human ingenuity to produce electricity. This force is none other than the power of moving water, channeled into what we know as hydroelectric power. As we delve into the specifics of this renewable energy source, it becomes clear that hydroelectricity is not just a method of generating power, but a testament to human innovation and our quest for sustainable living. The Basic Principle At its core, hydroelectric power plants exploit the potential energy of water stored in dams or occurring naturally in rivers. This water, when allowed to flow downwards through turbines, converts its potential energy into kinetic energy, which is then transformed into electrical energy. The process begins with the construction of a dam across a river, creating a reservoir. The height of the dam and the volume of water behind it determine the potential energy available. As water from the reservoir flows down through penstocks (large pipes), it reaches the turbine, causing it to spin. This spinning motion is what drives the generator to produce electricity. Turbines: The Heart of Hydroelectric Power Turbines are perhaps the most critical component of a hydroelectric power plant. They come in various types, including Francis, Kaplan, and Pelton turbines, each suited for different water head and flow conditions. The choice of turbine depends on the specific characteristics of the site where the power plant is located. For instance, high-head, low-flow sites typically use Pelton turbines, while low-head, high-flow sites might utilize Kaplan turbines. The efficiency of these turbines can reach up to 90%, making them highly effective in converting the kinetic energy of water into mechanical energy. Environmental Impact and Sustainability While hydroelectric power is often touted as a clean and renewable source of energy, its environmental impact cannot be overlooked. The creation of large reservoirs can lead to the displacement of communities, alteration of ecosystems, and changes in water quality. However, when properly managed, hydroelectric power plants can also provide additional benefits such as flood control, irrigation, and recreational areas. Moreover, advancements in technology are continually being made to minimize the ecological footprint of these facilities, ensuring that the production of hydroelectric power becomes increasingly sustainable. Economic Viability and Global Perspective The economic viability of hydroelectric power is significant, offering a relatively low-cost option for electricity generation once the initial investment in infrastructure is made. Globally, hydroelectric power is the largest source of renewable electricity, with countries like Norway, Brazil, and China leading in hydroelectric production. The development of hydroelectric projects requires careful planning, considering both the technical feasibility and the socio-environmental impacts. As the world moves towards reducing carbon emissions and embracing renewable energy sources, the role of hydroelectric power will continue to grow. Conclusion In conclusion, hydroelectric power stands as a beacon of human ingenuity, leveraging the natural force of water to generate electricity. Through its turbines, dams, and sophisticated engineering, hydroelectricity provides a clean, efficient, and largely renewable source of power. As we look to the future, harnessing the power of water will remain a vital component of our global strategy to combat climate change and ensure a sustainable energy supply for generations to come.",
